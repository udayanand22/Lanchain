            "Error:  `args[0]`: {'topic': 'Major deity in Hinduism\\n\\nShiva ( ; Sanskrit: शिव, lit. \\'The Auspicious One\\', IAST: Śiva [ɕɪʋɐ]), also known as Mahadeva ( ; Sanskrit: महादेव:, lit. \\'The Great God\\', IAST: Mahādevaḥ, [mɐɦaːd̪eːʋɐh]) and Hara, is one of the principal deities of Hinduism.[19] He is the Supreme Being in Shaivism, one of the major traditions within Hinduism.\\n\\nShiva is known as The Destroyer within the Trimurti, the Hindu trinity which also includes Brahma and Vishnu. In the Shaivite tradition, Shiva is the Supreme Lord who creates, protects and transforms the universe. In the goddess-oriented Shakta tradition, the Supreme Goddess (Devi) is regarded as the energy and creative power (Shakti) and the equal complementary partner of Shiva. Shiva is one of the five equivalent deities in Panchayatana puja of the Smarta tradition of Hinduism.\\n\\nShiva has many aspects, benevolent as well as fearsome. In benevolent aspects, he is depicted as an omniscient yogi who lives an ascetic life on Kailasa as well as a householder with his wife Parvati and his two children, Ganesha and Kartikeya. In his fierce aspects, he is often depicted slaying demons. Shiva is also known as Adiyogi (the first yogi), regarded as the patron god of yoga, meditation and the arts.[25] The iconographical attributes of Shiva are the serpent king Vasuki around his neck, the adorning crescent moon, the holy river Ganga flowing from his matted hair, the third eye on his forehead (the eye that turns everything in front of it into ashes when opened), the trishula or trident as his weapon, and the damaru. He is usually worshiped in the aniconic form of lingam.\\n\\nShiva has pre-Vedic roots, and the figure of Shiva evolved as an amalgamation of various older non-Vedic and Vedic deities, including the Rigvedic storm god Rudra who may also have non-Vedic origins, into a single major deity. Shiva is a pan-Hindu deity, revered widely by Hindus in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Indonesia (especially in Java and Bali).\\n\\nEtymology and other names\\n\\nAccording to the Monier-Williams Sanskrit dictionary, the word \"śiva\" (Devanagari: शिव, also transliterated as shiva) means \"auspicious, propitious, gracious, benign, kind, benevolent, friendly\".[30] The root words of śiva in folk etymology are śī which means \"in whom all things lie, pervasiveness\" and va which means \"embodiment of grace\".[30]\\n\\nThe word Shiva is used as an adjective in the Rig Veda ( c. 1700–1100 BCE), as an epithet for several Rigvedic deities, including Rudra.[32] The term Shiva also connotes \"liberation, final emancipation\" and \"the auspicious one\"; this adjectival usage is addressed to many deities in Vedic literature.[30] The term evolved from the Vedic Rudra-Shiva to the noun Shiva in the Epics and the Puranas, as an auspicious deity who is the \"creator, reproducer and dissolver\".[30]\\n\\nSharma presents another etymology with the Sanskrit root śarv-, which means \"to injure\" or \"to kill\",[35] interpreting the name to connote \"one who can kill the forces of darkness\".\\n\\nThe Sanskrit word śaiva means \"relating to the god Shiva\", and this term is the Sanskrit name both for one of the principal sects of Hinduism and for a member of that sect. It is used as an adjective to characterise certain beliefs and practices, such as Shaivism.[38]\\n\\nSome authors associate the name with the Tamil word śivappu meaning \"red\", noting that Shiva is linked to the Sun (śivan, \"the Red one\", in Tamil) and that Rudra is also called Babhru (brown, or red) in the Rigveda.[39][40] The Vishnu sahasranama interprets Shiva to have multiple meanings: \"The Pure One\", and \"the One who is not affected by three Guṇas of Prakṛti (Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas)\".\\n\\nShiva is known by many names such as Viswanatha (lord of the universe), Mahadeva, Mahandeo, Mahasu, Mahesha, Maheshvara, Shankara, Shambhu, Rudra, Hara, Trilochana, Devendra (chief of the gods), Neelakanta, Subhankara, Trilokinatha (lord of the three realms),[44][45][46] and Ghrneshwar (lord of compassion). The highest reverence for Shiva in Shaivism is reflected in his epithets Mahādeva (\"Great god\"; mahā \"Great\" and deva \"god\"),[49] Maheśvara (\"Great Lord\"; mahā \"great\" and īśvara \"lord\"),[51] and Parameśvara (\"Supreme Lord\").[52]\\n\\nSahasranama are medieval Indian texts that list a thousand names derived from aspects and epithets of a deity.[53] There are at least eight different versions of the Shiva Sahasranama, devotional hymns (stotras) listing many names of Shiva.[54] The version appearing in Book 13 (Anuśāsanaparvan) of the Mahabharata provides one such list.[a] Shiva also has Dasha-Sahasranamas (10,000 names) that are found in the Mahanyasa. The Shri Rudram Chamakam, also known as the Śatarudriya, is a devotional hymn to Shiva hailing him by many names.[55][56]\\n\\nHistorical development and literature\\n\\nAn ancient sculpture of Shiva at the Elephanta Caves, Maharashtra. 6th century CE\\n\\nAssimilation of traditions\\n\\nThe Shiva-related tradition is a major part of Hinduism, found all over the Indian subcontinent, such as India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Southeast Asia, such as Bali, Indonesia. Shiva has pre-Vedic tribal roots, having \"his origins in primitive tribes, signs and symbols.\" The figure of Shiva as he is known today is an amalgamation of various older deities into a single figure, due to the process of Sanskritization and the emergence of the Hindu synthesis in post-Vedic times. How the persona of Shiva converged as a composite deity is not well documented, a challenge to trace and has attracted much speculation.[61] According to Vijay Nath:\\n\\nVishnu and Siva [...] began to absorb countless local cults and deities within their folds. The latter were either taken to represent the multiple facets of the same god or else were supposed to denote different forms and appellations by which the god came to be known and worshipped. [...] Siva became identified with countless local cults by the sheer suffixing of Isa or Isvara to the name of the local deity, e.g., Bhutesvara, Hatakesvara, Chandesvara.\"\\n\\nAn example of assimilation took place in Maharashtra, where a regional deity named Khandoba is a patron deity of farming and herding castes. The foremost center of worship of Khandoba in Maharashtra is in Jejuri.[64] Khandoba has been assimilated as a form of Shiva himself, in which case he is worshipped in the form of a lingam.[66] Khandoba\\'s varied associations also include an identification with Surya and Karttikeya.[67]\\n\\nMyths about Shiva that were \"roughly contemporary with early Christianity\" existed that portrayed Shiva with many differences than how he is thought of now, and these mythical portrayals of Shiva were incorporated into later versions of him. For instance, he and the other gods, from the highest gods to the least powerful gods, were thought of as somewhat human in nature, creating emotions they had limited control over and having the ability to get in touch with their inner natures through asceticism like humans. In that era, Shiva was widely viewed as both the god of lust and of asceticism. In one story, he was seduced by a prostitute sent by the other gods, who were jealous of Shiva\\'s ascetic lifestyle he had lived for 1000 years.\\n\\nPre-Vedic elements\\n\\nPrehistoric art\\n\\nPrehistoric rock paintings dating to the Mesolithic from Bhimbetka rock shelters have been interpreted by some authors as depictions of Shiva.[b] However, Howard Morphy states that these prehistoric rock paintings of India, when seen in their context, are likely those of hunting party with animals, and that the figures in a group dance can be interpreted in many different ways.[72]\\n\\nIndus Valley and the Pashupati seal\\n\\nThe Pashupati seal discovered during excavation of the Indus Valley archaeological site of Mohenjo-Daro and showing a possible representation of a \"yogi\" or \"proto-Shiva\" figure as Paśupati (Lord of the Animals\" c. 2350 –2000 BCE\\n\\nOf several Indus valley seals that show animals, one seal that has attracted attention shows a large central figure, either horned or wearing a horned headdress and possibly ithyphallic,[note 2][73] seated in a posture reminiscent of the Lotus position, surrounded by animals. This figure was named by early excavators of Mohenjo-daro as Pashupati (Lord of Animals, Sanskrit paśupati),[74] an epithet of the later Hindu deities Shiva and Rudra. Sir John Marshall and others suggested that this figure is a prototype of Shiva, with three faces, seated in a \"yoga posture\" with the knees out and feet joined. Semi-circular shapes on the head were interpreted as two horns. Scholars such as Gavin Flood, John Keay and Doris Meth Srinivasan have expressed doubts about this suggestion.\\n\\nGavin Flood states that it is not clear from the seal that the figure has three faces, is seated in a yoga posture, or even that the shape is intended to represent a human figure. He characterises these views as \"speculative\", but adds that it is nevertheless possible that there are echoes of Shaiva iconographic themes, such as half-moon shapes resembling the horns of a bull. John Keay writes that \"he may indeed be an early manifestation of Lord Shiva as Pashu-pati\", but a couple of his specialties of this figure does not match with Rudra. Writing in 1997, Srinivasan interprets what John Marshall interpreted as facial as not human but more bovine, possibly a divine buffalo-man.\\n\\nThe interpretation of the seal continues to be disputed. McEvilley, for example, states that it is not possible to \"account for this posture outside the yogic account\".[81] Asko Parpola states that other archaeological finds such as the early Elamite seals dated to 3000–2750 BCE show similar figures and these have been interpreted as \"seated bull\" and not a yogi, and the bovine interpretation is likely more accurate.[82] Gregory L. Possehl in 2002, associated it with the water buffalo, and concluded that while it would be appropriate to recognise the figure as a deity, and its posture as one of ritual discipline, regarding it as a proto-Shiva would \"go too far\".[83]\\n\\nProto-Indo-European elements\\n\\nThe Vedic beliefs and practices of the pre-classical era were closely related to the hypothesised Proto-Indo-European religion,[84] and the pre-Islamic Indo-Iranian religion. The similarities between the iconography and theologies of Shiva with Greek and European deities have led to proposals for an Indo-European link for Shiva,[86][87] or lateral exchanges with ancient central Asian cultures.[88][89] His contrasting aspects such as being terrifying or blissful depending on the situation, are similar to those of the Greek god Dionysus,[90] as are their iconic associations with bull, snakes, anger, bravery, dancing and carefree life.[91][92] The ancient Greek texts of the time of Alexander the Great call Shiva \"Indian Dionysus\", or alternatively call Dionysus \"god of the Orient\".[91] Similarly, the use of phallic symbol[note 2] as an icon for Shiva is also found for Irish, Nordic, Greek (Dionysus[93]) and Roman deities, as was the idea of this aniconic column linking heaven and earth among early Indo-Aryans, states Roger Woodward.[86] Others contest such proposals, and suggest Shiva to have emerged from indigenous pre-Aryan tribal origins.\\n\\nRudra\\n\\nThree-headed Shiva, Gandhara, 2nd century AD\\n\\nShiva as we know him today shares many features with the Vedic god Rudra, and both Shiva and Rudra are viewed as the same personality in Hindu scriptures. The two names are used synonymously. Rudra, a Rigvedic deity with fearsome powers, was the god of the roaring storm. He is usually portrayed in accordance with the element he represents as a fierce, destructive deity. In RV 2.33, he is described as the \"Father of the Rudras\", a group of storm gods.[97][98]\\n\\nFlood notes that Rudra is an ambiguous god, peripheral in the Vedic pantheon, possibly indicating non-Vedic origins. Nevertheless, both Rudra and Shiva are akin to Wodan, the Germanic God of rage (\"wütte\") and the wild hunt.[page needed][page needed]\\n\\nAccording to Sadasivan, during the development of the Hindu synthesis attributes of the Buddha were transferred by Brahmins to Shiva, who was also linked with Rudra. The Rigveda has 3 out of 1,028 hymns dedicated to Rudra, and he finds occasional mention in other hymns of the same text. Hymn 10.92 of the Rigveda states that deity Rudra has two natures, one wild and cruel (Rudra), another that is kind and tranquil (Shiva).\\n\\nThe term Shiva also appears simply as an epithet, that means \"kind, auspicious\", one of the adjectives used to describe many different Vedic deities. While fierce ruthless natural phenomenon and storm-related Rudra is feared in the hymns of the Rigveda, the beneficial rains he brings are welcomed as Shiva aspect of him. This healing, nurturing, life-enabling aspect emerges in the Vedas as Rudra-Shiva, and in post-Vedic literature ultimately as Shiva who combines the destructive and constructive powers, the terrific and the gentle, as the ultimate recycler and rejuvenator of all existence.\\n\\nThe Vedic texts do not mention bull or any animal as the transport vehicle (vahana) of Rudra or other deities. However, post-Vedic texts such as the Mahabharata and the Puranas state the Nandi bull, the Indian zebu, in particular, as the vehicle of Rudra and of Shiva, thereby unmistakably linking them as same.\\n\\nAgni\\n\\nRudra and Agni have a close relationship.[note 3] The identification between Agni and Rudra in the Vedic literature was an important factor in the process of Rudra\\'s gradual transformation into Rudra-Shiva.[note 4] The identification of Agni with Rudra is explicitly noted in the Nirukta, an important early text on etymology, which says, \"Agni is also called Rudra.\"[107] The interconnections between the two deities are complex, and according to Stella Kramrisch:\\n\\nThe fire myth of Rudra-Śiva plays on the whole gamut of fire, valuing all its potentialities and phases, from conflagration to illumination.\\n\\nIn the Śatarudrīya, some epithets of Rudra, such as Sasipañjara (\"Of golden red hue as of flame\") and Tivaṣīmati (\"Flaming bright\"), suggest a fusing of the two deities.[note 5] Agni is said to be a bull,[109] and Shiva possesses a bull as his vehicle, Nandi. The horns of Agni, who is sometimes characterised as a bull, are mentioned.[110][111] In medieval sculpture, both Agni and the form of Shiva known as Bhairava have flaming hair as a special feature.[112]\\n\\nIndra\\n\\nPashupatinath Temple, Nepal, dedicated to Shiva as the lord of all beings\\n\\nAccording to Wendy Doniger, the Saivite fertility myths and some of the phallic characteristics of Shiva are inherited from Indra.[113] Doniger gives several reasons for her hypothesis. Both are associated with mountains, rivers, male fertility, fierceness, fearlessness, warfare, the transgression of established mores, the Aum sound, the Supreme Self. In the Rig Veda the term śiva is used to refer to Indra. (2.20.3,[note 6] 6.45.17,[115][116] and 8.93.3.[117]) Indra, like Shiva, is likened to a bull.[118][119] In the Rig Veda, Rudra is the father of the Maruts, but he is never associated with their warlike exploits as is Indra.[120]\\n\\nIndra himself may have been adopted by the Vedic Aryans from the Bactria–Margiana Culture. According to Anthony,\\n\\nMany of the qualities of Indo-Iranian god of might/victory, Verethraghna, were transferred to the adopted god Indra, who became the central deity of the developing Old Indic culture. Indra was the subject of 250 hymns, a quarter of the Rig Veda. He was associated more than any other deity with Soma, a stimulant drug (perhaps derived from Ephedra) probably borrowed from the BMAC religion. His rise to prominence was a peculiar trait of the Old Indic speakers.\\n\\nThe texts and artwork of Jainism show Indra as a dancer, although not identical generally resembling the dancing Shiva artwork found in Hinduism, particularly in their respective mudras. For example, in the Jain caves at Ellora, extensive carvings show dancing Indra next to the images of Tirthankaras in a manner similar to Shiva Nataraja. The similarities in the dance iconography suggests that there may be a link between ancient Indra and Shiva.\\n\\nDevelopment\\n\\nA few texts such as Atharvashiras Upanishad mention Rudra, and assert all gods are Rudra, everyone and everything is Rudra, and Rudra is the principle found in all things, their highest goal, the innermost essence of all reality that is visible or invisible. The Kaivalya Upanishad similarly, states Paul Deussen – a German Indologist and professor of philosophy, describes the self-realized man as who \"feels himself only as the one divine essence that lives in all\", who feels identity of his and everyone\\'s consciousness with Shiva (highest Atman), who has found this highest Atman within, in the depths of his heart.\\n\\nRudra\\'s evolution from a minor Vedic deity to a supreme being is first evidenced in the Shvetashvatara Upanishad (400–200 BCE), according to Gavin Flood, presenting the earliest seeds of theistic devotion to Rudra-Shiva. Here Rudra-Shiva is identified as the creator of the cosmos and liberator of Selfs from the birth-rebirth cycle. The Svetasvatara Upanishad set the tone for early Shaivite thought, especially in chapter 3 verse 2 where Shiva is equated with Brahman: \"Rudra is truly one; for the knowers of Brahman do not admit the existence of a second\".[128][129] The period of 200 BC to 100 AD also marks the beginning of the Shaiva tradition focused on the worship of Shiva as evidenced in other literature of this period. Other scholars such as Robert Hume and Doris Srinivasan state that the Shvetashvatara Upanishad presents pluralism, pantheism, or henotheism, rather than being a text just on Shiva theism.\\n\\nSelf-realization and Shaiva Upanishads He who sees himself in all beings,\\n\\nAnd all beings in him,\\n\\nattains the highest Brahman,\\n\\nnot by any other means. —Kaivalya Upanishad 10\\n\\nShaiva devotees and ascetics are mentioned in Patanjali\\'s Mahābhāṣya (2nd-century BCE) and in the Mahabharata.[133]\\n\\nThe earliest iconic artworks of Shiva may be from Gandhara and northwest parts of ancient India. There is some uncertainty as the artwork that has survived is damaged and they show some overlap with meditative Buddha-related artwork, but the presence of Shiva\\'s trident and phallic symbolism[note 2] in this art suggests it was likely Shiva. Numismatics research suggests that numerous coins of the ancient Kushan Empire (30–375 CE) that have survived, were images of a god who is probably Shiva. The Shiva in Kushan coins is referred to as Oesho of unclear etymology and origins, but the simultaneous presence of Indra and Shiva in the Kushan era artwork suggest that they were revered deities by the start of the Kushan Empire.[136]\\n\\nThe Shaiva Upanishads are a group of 14 minor Upanishads of Hinduism variously dated from the last centuries of the 1st millennium BCE through the 17th century. These extol Shiva as the metaphysical unchanging reality Brahman and the Atman (Self), and include sections about rites and symbolisms related to Shiva.\\n\\nThe Shaiva Puranas, particularly the Shiva Purana and the Linga Purana, present the various aspects of Shiva, mythologies, cosmology and pilgrimage (Tirtha) associated with him. The Shiva-related Tantra literature, composed between the 8th and 11th centuries, are regarded in devotional dualistic Shaivism as Sruti. Dualistic Shaiva Agamas which consider Self within each living being and Shiva as two separate realities (dualism, dvaita), are the foundational texts for Shaiva Siddhanta. Other Shaiva Agamas teach that these are one reality (monism, advaita), and that Shiva is the Self, the perfection and truth within each living being.[142] In Shiva related sub-traditions, there are ten dualistic Agama texts, eighteen qualified monism-cum-dualism Agama texts and sixty-four monism Agama texts.[143][144]\\n\\nShiva-related literature developed extensively across India in the 1st millennium CE and through the 13th century, particularly in Kashmir and Tamil Shaiva traditions. Shaivism gained immense popularity in Tamilakam as early as the 7th century CE, with poets such as Appar and Sambandar composing rich poetry that is replete with present features associated with the deity, such as his tandava dance, the mulavam (dumru), the aspect of holding fire, and restraining the proud flow of the Ganga upon his braid.[146] The monist Shiva literature posit absolute oneness, that is Shiva is within every man and woman, Shiva is within every living being, Shiva is present everywhere in the world including all non-living being, and there is no spiritual difference between life, matter, man and Shiva. The various dualistic and monist Shiva-related ideas were welcomed in medieval southeast Asia, inspiring numerous Shiva-related temples, artwork and texts in Indonesia, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia, with syncretic integration of local pre-existing theologies.\\n\\nPosition within Hinduism\\n\\nLingodbhava is a Shaiva sectarian icon where Shiva is depicted rising from the Lingam (an infinite fiery pillar) that narrates how Shiva is the foremost of the Trimurti; Brahma on the left and Vishnu on the right are depicted bowing to Shiva in the centre.\\n\\nShaivism\\n\\nShaivism is one of the four major sects of Hinduism, the others being Vaishnavism, Shaktism and the Smarta Tradition. Followers of Shaivism, called \"Shaivas\", revere Shiva as the Supreme Being. Shaivas believe that Shiva is All and in all, the creator, preserver, destroyer, revealer and concealer of all that is. He is not only the creator in Shaivism, but he is also the creation that results from him, he is everything and everywhere. Shiva is the primal Self, the pure consciousness and Absolute Reality in the Shaiva traditions. Shiva is also part of \\'Om\\' (ॐ) as a \\'U\\' (उ).[149]\\n\\nThe Shaivism theology is broadly grouped into two: the popular theology influenced by Shiva-Rudra in the Vedas, Epics and the Puranas; and the esoteric theology influenced by the Shiva and Shakti-related Tantra texts. The Vedic-Brahmanic Shiva theology includes both monist (Advaita) and devotional traditions (Dvaita), such as Tamil Shaiva Siddhanta and Lingayatism. Shiva temples feature items such as linga, Shiva-Parvati iconography, bull Nandi within the premises, and relief artwork showing aspects of Shiva.[152]\\n\\nThe Tantric Shiva (\"शिव\") tradition ignored the mythologies and Puranas related to Shiva, and depending on the sub-school developed a variety of practices. For example, historical records suggest the tantric Kapalikas (literally, the \\'skull-men\\') co-existed with and shared many Vajrayana Buddhist rituals, engaged in esoteric practices that revered Shiva and Shakti wearing skulls, begged with empty skulls, and sometimes used meat as a part of ritual.[153] In contrast, the esoteric tradition within Kashmir Shaivism has featured the Krama and Trika sub-traditions.[154] The Krama sub-tradition focussed on esoteric rituals around Shiva-Kali pair.[155] The Trika sub-tradition developed a theology of triads involving Shiva, combined it with an ascetic lifestyle focusing on personal Shiva in the pursuit of monistic self-liberation.[154][157]\\n\\nVaishnavism\\n\\nThe Vaishnava (Vishnu-oriented) literature acknowledges and discusses Shiva. Like Shaiva literature that presents Shiva as supreme, the Vaishnava literature presents Vishnu as supreme. However, both traditions are pluralistic and revere both Shiva and Vishnu (along with Devi), their texts do not show exclusivism, and Vaishnava texts such as the Bhagavata Purana while praising Krishna as the Ultimate Reality, also present Shiva and Shakti as a personalised form an equivalent to the same Ultimate Reality.[158][159][160] The texts of Shaivism tradition similarly praise Vishnu. The Skanda Purana, for example, states:\\n\\nVishnu is no one but Shiva, and he who is called Shiva is but identical with Vishnu. Skanda Purana, 1.8.20–21 [ 161 ]\\n\\nBoth traditions include legends about who is superior, about Shiva paying homage to Vishnu, and Vishnu paying homage to Shiva. However, in texts and artwork of either tradition, the mutual salutes are symbolism for complementarity.[162] The Mahabharata declares the unchanging Ultimate Reality (Brahman) to be identical to Shiva and to Vishnu,[163] that Vishnu is the highest manifestation of Shiva, and Shiva is the highest manifestation of Vishnu.[164]\\n\\nShaktism\\n\\nArdhanarishvara sculpture, Khajuraho, depicting Shiva with goddess Parvati as his equal half. In the Ardhanarisvara concept, the icon is presented as half-man and half woman.\\n\\nThe goddess-oriented Shakti tradition of Hinduism is based on the premise that the Supreme Principle and the Ultimate Reality called Brahman is female (Devi), but it treats the male as her equal and complementary partner. This partner is Shiva.\\n\\nThe earliest evidence of the tradition of reverence for the feminine with Rudra-Shiva context, is found in the Hindu scripture Rigveda, in a hymn called the Devi Sukta.[174]\\n\\nThe Devi Upanishad in its explanation of the theology of Shaktism, mentions and praises Shiva such as in its verse 19. Shiva, along with Vishnu, is a revered god in the Devi Mahatmya, a text of Shaktism considered by the tradition to be as important as the Bhagavad Gita.[178] The Ardhanarisvara concept co-mingles god Shiva and goddess Shakti by presenting an icon that is half-man and half woman, a representation and theme of union found in many Hindu texts and temples.[179][180]\\n\\nSmarta tradition\\n\\nOleograph by Raja Ravi Varma depicting a Shiva-centric Panchayatana. A bearded Shiva sits in the centre with his wife Parvati and their infant son Ganesha; surrounded by (clockwise from left upper corner) Ganesha, Devi, Vishnu, and Surya. Shiva\\'s mount is the bull Nandi below Shiva.\\n\\nIn the Smarta tradition of Hinduism, Shiva is a part of its Panchayatana puja.[181] This practice consists of the use of icons or anicons of five deities considered equivalent,[181] set in a quincunx pattern.[182] Shiva is one of the five deities, others being Vishnu, Devi (such as Parvati), Surya and Ganesha or Skanda or any personal god of devotee\\'s preference (Ishta Devata).\\n\\nPhilosophically, the Smarta tradition emphasises that all idols (murti) are icons to help focus on and visualise aspects of Brahman, rather than distinct beings. The ultimate goal in this practice is to transition past the use of icons, recognise the Absolute symbolised by the icons,[184] on the path to realising the nondual identity of one\\'s Atman (Self) and the Brahman.[185] Popularized by Adi Shankara, many Panchayatana mandalas and temples have been uncovered that are from the Gupta Empire period, and one Panchayatana set from the village of Nand (about 24 kilometres from Ajmer) has been dated to belong to the Kushan Empire era (pre-300 CE). The Kushan period set includes Shiva, Vishnu, Surya, Brahma and one deity whose identity is unclear.\\n\\nYoga\\n\\nShiva is considered the Great Yogi who is totally absorbed in himself – the transcendental reality. He is the Lord of Yogis, and the teacher of Yoga to sages. As Shiva Dakshinamurthi, states Stella Kramrisch, he is the supreme guru who \"teaches in silence the oneness of one\\'s innermost self (atman) with the ultimate reality (Brahman).\" Shiva is also an archetype for samhara (Sanskrit: संहार) or dissolution which includes transcendence of human misery by the dissolution of maya, which is why Shiva is associated with Yoga.[189][190]\\n\\nAdiyogi Shiva (the first Yogi) statue in Coimbatore\\n\\nThe theory and practice of Yoga, in different styles, has been a part of all major traditions of Hinduism, and Shiva has been the patron or spokesperson in numerous Hindu Yoga texts.[191][192] These contain the philosophy and techniques for Yoga. These ideas are estimated to be from or after the late centuries of the 1st millennium CE, and have survived as Yoga texts such as the Isvara Gita (literally, \\'Shiva\\'s song\\'), which Andrew Nicholson – a professor of Hinduism and Indian Intellectual History – states have had \"a profound and lasting influence on the development of Hinduism\".[193]\\n\\nOther famed Shiva-related texts influenced Hatha Yoga, integrated monistic (Advaita Vedanta) ideas with Yoga philosophy and inspired the theoretical development of Indian classical dance. These include the Shiva Sutras, the Shiva Samhita, and those by the scholars of Kashmir Shaivism such as the 10th-century scholar Abhinavagupta.[191][192][194] Abhinavagupta writes in his notes on the relevance of ideas related to Shiva and Yoga, by stating that \"people, occupied as they are with their own affairs, normally do nothing for others\", and Shiva and Yoga spirituality helps one look beyond, understand interconnectedness, and thus benefit both the individual and the world towards a more blissful state of existence.[195]\\n\\nTrimurti\\n\\nThe Trimurti is a concept in Hinduism in which the cosmic functions of creation, maintenance, and destruction are personified by the forms of Brahma the creator, Vishnu the maintainer or preserver and Shiva the destroyer or transformer.[196][197] These three deities have been called \"the Hindu triad\"[198] or the \"Great Triple deity\".[199] However, the ancient and medieval texts of Hinduism feature many triads of gods and goddesses, some of which do not include Shiva.[200]\\n\\nAttributes\\n\\nShiva with Parvati. Shiva is depicted three-eyed, the Ganges flowing through his matted hair, wearing ornaments of serpents and a skull garland, covered in ashes, and seated on a tiger skin.\\n\\nA seated Shiva holds an axe and deer in his hands.\\n\\nSiva with Moustache from Archaeological Museum GOA.\\n\\nForms and depictions\\n\\nShiva is often depicted as embodying attributes of ambiguity and paradox. His depictions are marked by the opposing themes including fierceness and innocence. This duality can be seen in the diverse epithets attributed to him and the rich tapestry of narratives that delineate his persona within Hindu mythology.[248]\\n\\nDestroyer and Benefactor\\n\\n[ 249 ] Left: Shiva is represented in his many aspects.Left: Bhairava icon of the fierce form of Shiva, 16th century Nepal; right: Shiva as a meditating yogi in Rishikesh\\n\\nIn Yajurveda, two contrary sets of attributes for both malignant or terrifying (Sanskrit: rudra) and benign or auspicious (Sanskrit: śiva) forms can be found, leading Chakravarti to conclude that \"all the basic elements which created the complex Rudra-Śiva sect of later ages are to be found here\".[250] In the Mahabharata, Shiva is depicted as \"the standard of invincibility, might, and terror\", as well as a figure of honour, delight, and brilliance.[251]\\n\\nThe duality of Shiva\\'s fearful and auspicious attributes appears in contrasted names. The name Rudra reflects Shiva\\'s fearsome aspects. According to traditional etymologies, the Sanskrit name Rudra is derived from the root rud-, which means \"to cry, howl\".[252] Stella Kramrisch notes a different etymology connected with the adjectival form raudra, which means \"wild, of rudra nature\", and translates the name Rudra as \"the wild one\" or \"the fierce god\".[253] R. K. Sharma follows this alternate etymology and translates the name as \"terrible\". Hara is an important name that occurs three times in the Anushasanaparvan version of the Shiva sahasranama, where it is translated in different ways each time it occurs, following a commentorial tradition of not repeating an interpretation. Sharma translates the three as \"one who captivates\", \"one who consolidates\", and \"one who destroys\". Kramrisch translates it as \"the ravisher\". Another of Shiva\\'s fearsome forms is as Kāla \"time\" and Mahākāla \"great time\", which ultimately destroys all things. The name Kāla appears in the Shiva Sahasranama, where it is translated by Ram Karan Sharma as \"(the Supreme Lord of) Time\". Bhairava \"terrible\" or \"frightful\" is a fierce form associated with annihilation. In contrast, the name Śaṇkara, \"beneficent\" or \"conferring happiness\" reflects his benign form. This name was adopted by the great Vedanta philosopher Adi Shankara ( c. 788 – c. 820), who is also known as Shankaracharya. The name Śambhu (Sanskrit: शम्भु swam-on its own; bhu-burn/shine) \"self-shining/ shining on its own\", also reflects this benign aspect.\\n\\nAscetic and householder\\n\\nShiva is depicted both as an ascetic mendicant (left as Bhikshatana ) and as a householder with his wife Parvati and sons Ganesha and Kartikeya (right).\\n\\nShiva is depicted as both an ascetic yogi and as a householder (grihasta), roles which have been traditionally mutually exclusive in Hindu society.[261] When depicted as a yogi, he may be shown sitting and meditating.[262] His epithet Mahāyogi (\"the great Yogi: Mahā = \"great\", Yogi = \"one who practices Yoga\") refers to his association with yoga.[263] While Vedic religion was conceived mainly in terms of sacrifice, it was during the Epic period that the concepts of tapas, yoga, and asceticism became more important, and the depiction of Shiva as an ascetic sitting in philosophical isolation reflects these later concepts.[264]\\n\\nAs a family man and householder, he has a wife, Parvati, and two sons, Ganesha and Kartikeya. His epithet Umāpati (\"The husband of Umā\") refers to this idea, and Sharma notes that two other variants of this name that mean the same thing, Umākānta and Umādhava, also appear in the sahasranama.[265] Umā in epic literature is known by many names, including the benign Pārvatī.[266][267] She is identified with Devi, the Divine Mother; Shakti (divine energy) as well as goddesses like Tripura Sundari, Durga, Kali, Kamakshi and Minakshi. The consorts of Shiva are the source of his creative energy. They represent the dynamic extension of Shiva onto this universe.[268] His son Ganesha is worshipped throughout India and Nepal as the Remover of Obstacles, Lord of Beginnings and Lord of Obstacles. Kartikeya is worshipped in Southern India (especially in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka) by the names Subrahmanya, Subrahmanyan, Shanmughan, Swaminathan and Murugan, and in Northern India by the names Skanda, Kumara, or Karttikeya.[269]\\n\\nSome regional deities are also identified as Shiva\\'s children. As one story goes, Shiva is enticed by the beauty and charm of Mohini, Vishnu\\'s female avatar, and procreates with her. As a result of this union, Shasta – identified with regional deities Ayyappan and Aiyanar – is born.[270][271][272][273] In outskirts of Ernakulam in Kerala, a deity named Vishnumaya is stated to be offspring of Shiva and invoked in local exorcism rites, but this deity is not traceable in Hindu pantheon and is possibly a local tradition with \"vaguely Chinese\" style rituals, states Saletore.[274] In some traditions, Shiva has daughters like the serpent-goddess Manasa and Ashokasundari.[276] According to Doniger, two regional stories depict demons Andhaka and Jalandhara as the children of Shiva who war with him, and are later destroyed by Shiva.[277]\\n\\nIconographic forms\\n\\nThe depiction of Shiva as Nataraja (Sanskrit नटराज; Naṭarāja) is a form (mūrti) of Shiva as \"Lord of Dance\".[278][279] The names Nartaka (\"dancer\") and Nityanarta (\"eternal dancer\") appear in the Shiva Sahasranama.[280] His association with dance and also with music is prominent in the Puranic period.[281] In addition to the specific iconographic form known as Nataraja, various other types of dancing forms (Sanskrit: nṛtyamūrti) are found in all parts of India, with many well-defined varieties in Tamil Nadu in particular.[282] The two most common forms of the dance are the Tandava, which later came to denote the powerful and masculine dance as Kala-Mahakala associated with the destruction of the world. When it requires the world or universe to be destroyed, Shiva does it by the Tandava, and Lasya, which is graceful and delicate and expresses emotions on a gentle level and is considered the feminine dance attributed to the goddess Parvati.[284][285] Lasya is regarded as the female counterpart of Tandava.[285] The Tandava-Lasya dances are associated with the destruction-creation of the world.[286][287][288]\\n\\nDakshinamurti (Sanskrit दक्षिणामूर्ति; Dakṣiṇāmūrti, \"[facing] south form\")[289] represents Shiva in his aspect as a teacher of yoga, music, and wisdom and giving exposition on the shastras.[290] Dakshinamurti is depicted as a figure seated upon a deer-throne surrounded by sages receiving instruction.[291] Dakshinamurti\\'s depiction in Indian art is mostly restricted to Tamil Nadu.[292]\\n\\nBhikshatana (Sanskrit भिक्षाटन; Bhikṣāṭana, \"wandering about for alms, mendicancy\"[293]) depicts Shiva as a divine medicant. He is depicted as a nude four-armed man adorned with ornaments who holds a begging bowl in his hand and is followed by demonic attendants. He is associated with his penance for committing brahmicide as Bhirava and with his encounters with the sages and their wives in the Deodar forest.\\n\\nTripurantaka (Sanskrit त्रिपुरांतक; Tripurāntaka, \"ender of Tripura\" ) is associated with his destruction of the three cities (Tripura) of the Asuras.[295] He is depicted with four arms, the upper pair holding an axe and a deer, and the lower pair wielding a bow and arrow.\\n\\nArdhanarishvara (Sanskrit: अर्धनारीश्वर; Ardhanārīśvara, \"the lord who is half woman\"[296]) is conjunct form of Shiva with Parvati. Adhanarishvara is depicted with one half of the body as male and the other half as female. Ardhanarishvara represents the synthesis of masculine and feminine energies of the universe (Purusha and Prakriti) and illustrates how Shakti, the female principle of God, is inseparable from (or the same as, according to some interpretations) Shiva, the male principle of God, and vice versa.[297]\\n\\nKalyanasundara-murti (Sanskrit कल्याणसुन्दर-मूर्ति, literally \"icon of beautiful marriage\") is the depiction of Shiva\\'s marriage to Parvati. The divine couple are often depicted performing the panigrahana (Sanskrit \"accepting the hand\") ritual from traditional Hindu wedding ceremonies.[298] The most basic form of this murti consists of only Shiva and Parvati together, but in more elaborate forms they are accompanied by other persons, sometimes including Parvati\\'s parents, as well as deities (often with Vishnu and Lakshmi standing as Parvati\\'s parents, Brahma as the officiating priest, and various other deities as attendants or guests).\\n\\nSomaskanda is the depiction of Shiva, Parvati, and their son Skanda (Kartikeya), popular during the Pallava Dynasty in southern India.\\n\\nAstamurti (Sanskrit: अष्टमूर्ति) is an iconographic depiction of Shiva as composed of eight attributes: Rudra, Śarva, Paśupati, Ugra, Aśani, Bhava, Mahādeva, and Īśāna—some of which overlap with Pañcānana, described below.\\n\\nPañcānana (Sanskrit: पञ्चानन), also called the pañcabrahma, is a form of Shiva depicting him as having five faces which correspond to his five divine activities (pañcakṛtya): creation (sṛṣṭi), preservation (sthithi), destruction (saṃhāra), concealing grace (tirobhāva), and revealing grace (anugraha). Five is a sacred number for Shiva.[299] One of his most important mantras has five syllables (namaḥ śivāya).[300]\\n\\nThe 10th century five headed Shiva, Sadashiva, Cambodia\\n\\nShiva\\'s body is said to consist of five mantras, called the pañcabrahman.[301] As forms of God, each of these have their own names and distinct iconography:[302] These are represented as the five faces of Shiva and are associated in various texts with the five elements, the five senses, the five organs of perception, and the five organs of action.[303][304] Doctrinal differences and, possibly, errors in transmission, have resulted in some differences between texts in details of how these five forms are linked with various attributes.[305] The overall meaning of these associations is summarised by Stella Kramrisch,\\n\\nThrough these transcendent categories, Śiva, the ultimate reality, becomes the efficient and material cause of all that exists.\\n\\nAccording to the Pañcabrahma Upanishad:\\n\\nOne should know all things of the phenomenal world as of a fivefold character, for the reason that the eternal verity of Śiva is of the character of the fivefold Brahman. (Pañcabrahma Upanishad 31)[307]\\n\\nIn the hymn of Manikkavacakar\\'s Thiruvasagam, he testifies that Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram had, by the pre-Chola period, an abstract or \\'cosmic\\' symbolism linked to five elements (Pancha Bhoota) including ether. Nataraja is a significant visual interpretation of Brahman and a dance posture of Shiva.[309] Sharada Srinivasan notes that, Nataraja is described as Satcitananda or \"Being, Consciousness and Bliss\" in the Shaiva Siddhanta text Kunchitangrim Bhaje, resembling the Advaita doctrine, or \"abstract monism,\" of Adi Shankara, \"which holds the individual Self (Jīvātman) and supream Self (Paramātmā) to be one,\" while \"an earlier hymn to Nataraja by Manikkavachakar identifies him with the unitary supreme consciousness, by using Tamil word Or Unarve, rather than Sanskrit Chit.\" This may point to an \"osmosis\" of ideas in medieval India, states Srinivasan.\\n\\nLingam\\n\\nThe Linga Purana states, \"Shiva is signless, without color, taste, smell, that is beyond word or touch, without quality, motionless and changeless\".[311] The source of the universe is the signless, and all of the universe is the manifested Linga, a union of unchanging Principles and the ever changing nature.[311] The Linga Purana and the Shiva Gita texts builds on this foundation.[313] Linga, states Alain Daniélou, means sign.[311] It is an important concept in Hindu texts, wherein Linga is a manifested sign and nature of someone or something. It accompanies the concept of Brahman, which as invisible signless and existent Principle, is formless or linga-less.[311]\\n\\nThe Shvetashvatara Upanishad states one of the three significations, the primary one, of Lingam as \"the imperishable Purusha\", the absolute reality, where says the linga as \"sign\", a mark that provides the existence of Brahman, thus the original meaning as \"sign\". Furthermore, it says \"Shiva, the Supreme Lord, has no liūga\", liuga (Sanskrit: लिऊग IAST: liūga) meaning Shiva is transcendent, beyond any characteristic and, specifically the sign of gender.\\n\\nApart from anthropomorphic images of Shiva, he is also represented in aniconic form of a lingam. These are depicted in various designs. One common form is the shape of a vertical rounded column in the centre of a lipped, disk-shaped object, the yoni, symbolism for the goddess Shakti.[316] In Shiva temples, the linga is typically present in its sanctum sanctorum and is the focus of votary offerings such as milk, water, flower petals, fruit, fresh leaves, and rice.[316] According to Monier Williams and Yudit Greenberg, linga literally means \\'mark, sign or emblem\\', and also refers to a \"mark or sign from which the existence of something else can be reliably inferred\". It implies the regenerative divine energy innate in nature, symbolised by Shiva.[317][318]\\n\\nSome scholars, such as Wendy Doniger, view linga as merely a phallic symbol,[319][320][321][322] although this interpretation is criticised by others, including Swami Vivekananda,[323] Sivananda Saraswati,[324] Stella Kramrisch, Swami Agehananda Bharati,[326] S.

Balagangadhara,[327] and others.[327][328][329][330] According to Moriz Winternitz, the linga in the Shiva tradition is \"only a symbol of the productive and creative principle of nature as embodied in Shiva\", and it has no historical trace in any obscene phallic cult.[331] According to Sivananda Saraswati, westerners who are curiously passionate and have impure understanding or intelligence, incorrectly assume Siva Linga as a phallus or sex organ.[324] Later on, Sivananda Saraswati mentions that, this is not only a serious mistake, but also a grave blunder.[324]\\n\\nThe worship of the lingam originated from the famous hymn in the Atharva-Veda Samhitâ sung in praise of the Yupa-Stambha, the sacrificial post. In that hymn, a description is found of the beginningless and endless Stambha or Skambha, and it is shown that the said Skambha is put in place of the eternal Brahman. Just as the Yajna (sacrificial) fire, its smoke, ashes, and flames, the Soma plant, and the ox that used to carry on its back the wood for the Vedic sacrifice gave place to the conceptions of the brightness of Shiva\\'s body, his tawny matted hair, his blue throat, and the riding on the bull of the Shiva, the Yupa-Skambha gave place in time to the Shiva-Linga.[332][333] In the text Linga Purana, the same hymn is expanded in the shape of stories, meant to establish the glory of the great Stambha and the superiority of Shiva as Mahadeva.[333]\\n\\nThe oldest known archaeological linga as an icon of Shiva is the Gudimallam lingam from 3rd-century BCE.[316] In Shaivism pilgrimage tradition, twelve major temples of Shiva are called Jyotirlinga, which means \"linga of light\", and these are located across India.[334]\\n\\nAvatars\\n\\nPuranic scriptures contain occasional references to \"ansh\" – literally \\'portion, or avatars of Shiva\\', but the idea of Shiva avatars is not universally accepted in Shaivism.[335] The Linga Purana mentions twenty-eight forms of Shiva which are sometimes seen as avatars,[336] however such mention is unusual and the avatars of Shiva is relatively rare in Shaivism compared to the well emphasised concept of Vishnu avatars in Vaishnavism.[337][339] Some Vaishnava literature reverentially link Shiva to characters in its Puranas. For example, in the Hanuman Chalisa, Hanuman is identified as the eleventh avatar of Shiva.[340][341][342] The Bhagavata Purana and the Vishnu Purana claim sage Durvasa to be a portion of Shiva.[345] Some medieval era writers have called the Advaita Vedanta philosopher Adi Shankara an incarnation of Shiva.[346]\\n\\nTemple\\n\\nFestivals\\n\\nMaha Shivaratri festival is observed in the night, usually in lighted temples or special prabha (above).\\n\\nThere is a Shivaratri in every lunar month on its 13th night/14th day,[347] but once a year in late winter (February/March) and before the arrival of spring, marks Maha Shivaratri which means \"the Great Night of Shiva\".\\n\\nMaha Shivaratri is a major Hindu festival, but one that is solemn and theologically marks a remembrance of \"overcoming darkness and ignorance\" in life and the world, and meditation about the polarities of existence, of Shiva and a devotion to humankind.[347] It is observed by reciting Shiva-related poems, chanting prayers, remembering Shiva, fasting, doing Yoga and meditating on ethics and virtues such as self-restraint, honesty, noninjury to others, forgiveness, introspection, self-repentance and the discovery of Shiva. The ardent devotees keep awake all night. Others visit one of the Shiva temples or go on pilgrimage to Jyotirlingam shrines. Those who visit temples, offer milk, fruits, flowers, fresh leaves and sweets to the lingam. Some communities organise special dance events, to mark Shiva as the lord of dance, with individual and group performances.[351] According to Jones and Ryan, Maha Sivaratri is an ancient Hindu festival which probably originated around the 5th-century.\\n\\nAnother major festival involving Shiva worship is Kartik Purnima, commemorating Shiva\\'s victory over the three demons known as Tripurasura. Across India, various Shiva temples are illuminated throughout the night. Shiva icons are carried in procession in some places.[352]\\n\\nThiruvathira is a festival observed in Kerala dedicated to Shiva. It is believed that on this day, Parvati met Shiva after her long penance and Shiva took her as his wife.[353] On this day Hindu women performs the Thiruvathirakali accompanied by Thiruvathira paattu (folk songs about Parvati and her longing and penance for Shiva\\'s affection).[354]\\n\\nRegional festivals dedicated to Shiva include the Chithirai festival in Madurai around April/May, one of the largest festivals in South India, celebrating the wedding of Minakshi (Parvati) and Shiva. The festival is one where both the Vaishnava and Shaiva communities join the celebrations, because Vishnu gives away his sister Minakshi in marriage to Shiva.\\n\\nSome Shaktism-related festivals revere Shiva along with the goddess considered primary and Supreme. These include festivals dedicated to Annapurna such as Annakuta and those related to Durga. In Himalayan regions such as Nepal, as well as in northern, central and western India, the festival of Teej is celebrated by girls and women in the monsoon season, in honour of goddess Parvati, with group singing, dancing and by offering prayers in Parvati-Shiva temples.[357][358]\\n\\nThe ascetic, Vedic and Tantric sub-traditions related to Shiva, such as those that became ascetic warriors during the Islamic rule period of India,[359][360] celebrate the Kumbha Mela festival. This festival cycles every 12 years, in four pilgrimage sites within India, with the event moving to the next site after a gap of three years. The biggest is in Prayaga (renamed Allahabad during the Mughal rule era), where millions of Hindus of different traditions gather at the confluence of rivers Ganges and Yamuna. In the Hindu tradition, the Shiva-linked ascetic warriors (Nagas) get the honour of starting the event by entering the Sangam first for bathing and prayers.\\n\\nIn Pakistan, major Shivaratri celebration occurs at the Umarkot Shiv Mandir in the Umarkot. The three-day Shivarathri celebration at the temple is attended by around 250,000 people.[362]\\n\\nBeyond the Indian subcontinent and Hinduism\\n\\nIndonesia\\n\\nIn Indonesian Shaivism the popular name for Shiva has been Batara Guru, which is derived from Sanskrit Bhattāraka which means \"noble lord\". He is conceptualised as a kind spiritual teacher, the first of all Gurus in Indonesian Hindu texts, mirroring the Dakshinamurti aspect of Shiva in the Indian subcontinent. However, the Batara Guru has more aspects than the Indian Shiva, as the Indonesian Hindus blended their spirits and heroes with him. Batara Guru\\'s wife in Southeast Asia is the same Hindu deity Durga, who has been popular since ancient times, and she too has a complex character with benevolent and fierce manifestations, each visualised with different names such as Uma, Sri, Kali and others.[365] In contrast to Hindu religious texts, whether Vedas or Puranas, in Javanese puppetry (wayang) books, Batara Guru is the king of the gods who regulates and creates the world system. In the classic book that is used as a reference for the puppeteers, it is said that Sanghyang Manikmaya or Batara Guru was created from a sparkling light by Sang Hyang Tunggal, along with the blackish light which is the origin of Ismaya.[367][368] Shiva has been called Sadāśiva, Paramasiva, Mahādeva in benevolent forms, and Kāla, Bhairava, Mahākāla in his fierce forms.\\n\\nThe Indonesian Hindu texts present the same philosophical diversity of Shaivite traditions found in the Indian subcontinent. However, among the texts that have survived into the contemporary era, the more common are of those of Shaiva Siddhanta (locally also called Siwa Siddhanta, Sridanta).\\n\\nDuring the pre-Islamic period on the island of Java, Shaivism and Buddhism were considered very close and allied religions, though not identical religions. The medieval-era Indonesian literature equates Buddha with Siwa (Shiva) and Janardana (Vishnu).[371] This tradition continues in predominantly Hindu Bali Indonesia in the modern era, where Buddha is considered the younger brother of Shiva.\\n\\nCentral Asia\\n\\nThe worship of Shiva became popular in Central Asia through the influence of the Hephthalite Empire[373] and Kushan Empire. Shaivism was also popular in Sogdia and the Kingdom of Yutian as found from the wall painting from Penjikent on the river Zervashan.[374] In this depiction, Shiva is portrayed with a sacred halo and a sacred thread (Yajnopavita).[374] He is clad in tiger skin while his attendants are wearing Sogdian dress.[374] A panel from Dandan Oilik shows Shiva in His Trimurti form with Shakti kneeling on her right thigh.[374][375] Another site in the Taklamakan Desert depicts him with four legs, seated cross-legged on a cushioned seat supported by two bulls.[374] It is also noted that the Zoroastrian wind god Vayu-Vata took on the iconographic appearance of Shiva.[375]\\n\\nSikhism\\n\\nThe Japuji Sahib of the Guru Granth Sahib says: \"The Guru is Shiva, the Guru is Vishnu and Brahma; the Guru is Paarvati and Lakhshmi.\"[376] In the same chapter, it also says: \"Shiva speaks, and the Siddhas listen.\" In Dasam Granth, Guru Gobind Singh has mentioned two avatars of Rudra: Dattatreya Avatar and Parasnath Avatar.[377]\\n\\nBuddhism\\n\\nMahakala, c. 1500 CE Tibetan Thangka\\n\\nShiva is mentioned in the Buddhist Tantras and worshipped as the fierce deity Mahākāla in Vajrayana, Chinese Esoteric, and Tibetan Buddhism.[378] In the cosmologies of Buddhist Tantras, Shiva is depicted as passive, with Shakti being his active counterpart: Shiva as Prajña and Shakti as Upāya.[379][380]\\n\\nIn Mahayana Buddhism, Shiva is depicted as Maheshvara, a deva living in Akanishta Devaloka. In Theravada Buddhism, Shiva is depicted as Ishana, a deva residing in the 6th heaven of Kamadhatu along with Sakra Indra. In Vajrayana Buddhism, Shiva is depicted as Mahakala, a dharma protecting Bodhisattva. In most forms of Buddhism, the position of Shiva is lesser than that of Mahabrahma or Sakra Indra. In Mahayana Buddhist texts, Shiva (Maheshvara) becomes a buddha called Bhasmeshvara Buddha (\"Buddha of ashes\").[381]\\n\\nPaintings of Shiva and Parvati in Kizil Caves Xinjiang , China. The two are at the bottom right of the bottom image\\n\\nIn China and Taiwan, Shiva, better known there as Maheśvara (Chinese: 大自在天; pinyin: Dàzìzàitiān; or Chinese: 摩醯首羅天 pinyin: Móxīshǒuluótiān) is considered one of the Twenty Devas (Chinese: 二十諸天, pinyin: Èrshí Zhūtiān) or the Twenty-Four Devas (Chinese: 二十四諸天, pinyin: Èrshísì zhūtiān) who are a group of dharmapalas that manifest to protect the Buddhist dharma.[382] Statues of him are often enshrined in the Mahavira Halls of Chinese Buddhist temples along with the other devas. In Kizil Caves in Xinjiang, there are numerous caves that depict Shiva in the buddhist shrines through wall paintings.[383][384][385] In addition, he is also regarded as one of thirty-three manifestations of Avalokitesvara in the Lotus Sutra.[386] In Mahayana Buddhist cosmology, Maheśvara resides in Akaniṣṭha, highest of the Śuddhāvāsa (\"Pure Abodes\") wherein Anāgāmi (\"Non-returners\") who are already on the path to Arhathood and who will attain enlightenment are born.\\n\\nDaikokuten, one of the Seven Lucky Gods in Japan, is considered to be evolved from Shiva. The god enjoys an exalted position as a household deity in Japan and is worshipped as the god of wealth and fortune.[387] The name is the Japanese equivalent of Mahākāla, the Buddhist name for Shiva.[388]\\n\\nIn popular culture\\n\\nIn contemporary culture, Shiva is depicted in art, films, and books. He has been referred to as \"the god of cool things\"[391] and a \"bonafide rock hero\".[392] One popular film was the 1967 Kannada movie Gange Gowri.[393]\\n\\nA 1990s television series of DD National titled Om Namah Shivay was also based on legends of Shiva.[394] Amish Tripathi\\'s 2010 book Shiva Trilogy has sold over a million copies.[391] Devon Ke Dev...Mahadev (2011–2014), a television serial about Shiva on the Life OK channel was among the most watched shows at its peak popularity.[395] Another popular film was the 2022 Gujarati language movie Har Har Mahadev.[393]\\n\\nSee also\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n^ This is the source for the version presented in Chidbhavananda, who refers to it being from the Mahabharata but does not explicitly clarify which of the two Mahabharata versions he is using.

In the Shaivite tradition, Shiva is the Supreme Lord who creates, protects and transforms the universe. In the goddess-oriented Shakta tradition, the Supreme Goddess (Devi) is regarded as the energy and creative power (Shakti) and the equal complementary partner of Shiva. Shiva is one of the five equivalent deities in Panchayatana puja of the Smarta tradition of Hinduism.\\n\\nShiva has many aspects, benevolent as well as fearsome. In benevolent aspects, he is depicted as an omniscient yogi who lives an ascetic life on Kailasa as well as a householder with his wife Parvati and his two children, Ganesha and Kartikeya. In his fierce aspects, he is often depicted slaying demons. Shiva is also known as Adiyogi (the first yogi), regarded as the patron god of yoga, meditation and the arts.[25] The iconographical attributes of Shiva are the serpent king Vasuki around his neck, the adorning crescent moon, the holy river Ganga flowing from his matted hair, the third eye on his forehead (the eye that turns everything in front of it into ashes when opened), the trishula or trident as his weapon, and the damaru. He is usually worshiped in the aniconic form of lingam.\\n\\nShiva has pre-Vedic roots, and the figure of Shiva evolved as an amalgamation of various older non-Vedic and Vedic deities, including the Rigvedic storm god Rudra who may also have non-Vedic origins, into a single major deity. Shiva is a pan-Hindu deity, revered widely by Hindus in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Indonesia (especially in Java and Bali).\\n\\nEtymology and other names\\n\\nAccording to the Monier-Williams Sanskrit dictionary, the word \"śiva\" (Devanagari: शिव, also transliterated as shiva) means \"auspicious, propitious, gracious, benign, kind, benevolent, friendly\".[30] The root words of śiva in folk etymology are śī which means \"in whom all things lie, pervasiveness\" and va which means \"embodiment of grace\".[30]\\n\\nThe word Shiva is used as an adjective in the Rig Veda ( c. 1700–1100 BCE), as an epithet for several Rigvedic deities, including Rudra.[32] The term Shiva also connotes \"liberation, final emancipation\" and \"the auspicious one\"; this adjectival usage is addressed to many deities in Vedic literature.[30] The term evolved from the Vedic Rudra-Shiva to the noun Shiva in the Epics and the Puranas, as an auspicious deity who is the \"creator, reproducer and dissolver\".[30]\\n\\nSharma presents another etymology with the Sanskrit root śarv-, which means \"to injure\" or \"to kill\",[35] interpreting the name to connote \"one who can kill the forces of darkness\".\\n\\nThe Sanskrit word śaiva means \"relating to the god Shiva\", and this term is the Sanskrit name both for one of the principal sects of Hinduism and for a member of that sect. It is used as an adjective to characterise certain beliefs and practices, such as Shaivism.[38]\\n\\nSome authors associate the name with the Tamil word śivappu meaning \"red\", noting that Shiva is linked to the Sun (śivan, \"the Red one\", in Tamil) and that Rudra is also called Babhru (brown, or red) in the Rigveda.[39][40] The Vishnu sahasranama interprets Shiva to have multiple meanings: \"The Pure One\", and \"the One who is not affected by three Guṇas of Prakṛti (Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas)\".\\n\\nShiva is known by many names such as Viswanatha (lord of the universe), Mahadeva, Mahandeo, Mahasu, Mahesha, Maheshvara, Shankara, Shambhu, Rudra, Hara, Trilochana, Devendra (chief of the gods), Neelakanta, Subhankara, Trilokinatha (lord of the three realms),[44][45][46] and Ghrneshwar (lord of compassion). The highest reverence for Shiva in Shaivism is reflected in his epithets Mahādeva (\"Great god\"; mahā \"Great\" and deva \"god\"),[49] Maheśvara (\"Great Lord\"; mahā \"great\" and īśvara \"lord\"),[51] and Parameśvara (\"Supreme Lord\").[52]\\n\\nSahasranama are medieval Indian texts that list a thousand names derived from aspects and epithets of a deity.[53] There are at least eight different versions of the Shiva Sahasranama, devotional hymns (stotras) listing many names of Shiva.[54] The version appearing in Book 13 (Anuśāsanaparvan) of the Mahabharata provides one such list.[a] Shiva also has Dasha-Sahasranamas (10,000 names) that are found in the Mahanyasa. The Shri Rudram Chamakam, also known as the Śatarudriya, is a devotional hymn to Shiva hailing him by many names.[55][56]\\n\\nHistorical development and literature\\n\\nAn ancient sculpture of Shiva at the Elephanta Caves, Maharashtra. 6th century CE\\n\\nAssimilation of traditions\\n\\nThe Shiva-related tradition is a major part of Hinduism, found all over the Indian subcontinent, such as India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Southeast Asia, such as Bali, Indonesia. Shiva has pre-Vedic tribal roots, having \"his origins in primitive tribes, signs and symbols.\" The figure of Shiva as he is known today is an amalgamation of various older deities into a single figure, due to the process of Sanskritization and the emergence of the Hindu synthesis in post-Vedic times. How the persona of Shiva converged as a composite deity is not well documented, a challenge to trace and has attracted much speculation.[61] According to Vijay Nath:\\n\\nVishnu and Siva [...] began to absorb countless local cults and deities within their folds. The latter were either taken to represent the multiple facets of the same god or else were supposed to denote different forms and appellations by which the god came to be known and worshipped. [...] Siva became identified with countless local cults by the sheer suffixing of Isa or Isvara to the name of the local deity, e.g., Bhutesvara, Hatakesvara, Chandesvara.\"\\n\\nAn example of assimilation took place in Maharashtra, where a regional deity named Khandoba is a patron deity of farming and herding castes. The foremost center of worship of Khandoba in Maharashtra is in Jejuri.[64] Khandoba has been assimilated as a form of Shiva himself, in which case he is worshipped in the form of a lingam.[66] Khandoba\\'s varied associations also include an identification with Surya and Karttikeya.[67]\\n\\nMyths about Shiva that were \"roughly contemporary with early Christianity\" existed that portrayed Shiva with many differences than how he is thought of now, and these mythical portrayals of Shiva were incorporated into later versions of him. For instance, he and the other gods, from the highest gods to the least powerful gods, were thought of as somewhat human in nature, creating emotions they had limited control over and having the ability to get in touch with their inner natures through asceticism like humans. In that era, Shiva was widely viewed as both the god of lust and of asceticism. In one story, he was seduced by a prostitute sent by the other gods, who were jealous of Shiva\\'s ascetic lifestyle he had lived for 1000 years.\\n\\nPre-Vedic elements\\n\\nPrehistoric art\\n\\nPrehistoric rock paintings dating to the Mesolithic from Bhimbetka rock shelters have been interpreted by some authors as depictions of Shiva.[b] However, Howard Morphy states that these prehistoric rock paintings of India, when seen in their context, are likely those of hunting party with animals, and that the figures in a group dance can be interpreted in many different ways.[72]\\n\\nIndus Valley and the Pashupati seal\\n\\nThe Pashupati seal discovered during excavation of the Indus Valley archaeological site of Mohenjo-Daro and showing a possible representation of a \"yogi\" or \"proto-Shiva\" figure as Paśupati (Lord of the Animals\" c. 2350 –2000 BCE\\n\\nOf several Indus valley seals that show animals, one seal that has attracted attention shows a large central figure, either horned or wearing a horned headdress and possibly ithyphallic,[note 2][73] seated in a posture reminiscent of the Lotus position, surrounded by animals. This figure was named by early excavators of Mohenjo-daro as Pashupati (Lord of Animals, Sanskrit paśupati),[74] an epithet of the later Hindu deities Shiva and Rudra. Sir John Marshall and others suggested that this figure is a prototype of Shiva, with three faces, seated in a \"yoga posture\" with the knees out and feet joined. Semi-circular shapes on the head were interpreted as two horns. Scholars such as Gavin Flood, John Keay and Doris Meth Srinivasan have expressed doubts about this suggestion.\\n\\nGavin Flood states that it is not clear from the seal that the figure has three faces, is seated in a yoga posture, or even that the shape is intended to represent a human figure. He characterises these views as \"speculative\", but adds that it is nevertheless possible that there are echoes of Shaiva iconographic themes, such as half-moon shapes resembling the horns of a bull. John Keay writes that \"he may indeed be an early manifestation of Lord Shiva as Pashu-pati\", but a couple of his specialties of this figure does not match with Rudra. Writing in 1997, Srinivasan interprets what John Marshall interpreted as facial as not human but more bovine, possibly a divine buffalo-man.\\n\\nThe interpretation of the seal continues to be disputed. McEvilley, for example, states that it is not possible to \"account for this posture outside the yogic account\".[81] Asko Parpola states that other archaeological finds such as the early Elamite seals dated to 3000–2750 BCE show similar figures and these have been interpreted as \"seated bull\" and not a yogi, and the bovine interpretation is likely more accurate.[82] Gregory L. Possehl in 2002, associated it with the water buffalo, and concluded that while it would be appropriate to recognise the figure as a deity, and its posture as one of ritual discipline, regarding it as a proto-Shiva would \"go too far\".[83]\\n\\nProto-Indo-European elements\\n\\nThe Vedic beliefs and practices of the pre-classical era were closely related to the hypothesised Proto-Indo-European religion,[84] and the pre-Islamic Indo-Iranian religion. The similarities between the iconography and theologies of Shiva with Greek and European deities have led to proposals for an Indo-European link for Shiva,[86][87] or lateral exchanges with ancient central Asian cultures.[88][89] His contrasting aspects such as being terrifying or blissful depending on the situation, are similar to those of the Greek god Dionysus,[90] as are their iconic associations with bull, snakes, anger, bravery, dancing and carefree life.[91][92] The ancient Greek texts of the time of Alexander the Great call Shiva \"Indian Dionysus\", or alternatively call Dionysus \"god of the Orient\".[91] Similarly, the use of phallic symbol[note 2] as an icon for Shiva is also found for Irish, Nordic, Greek (Dionysus[93]) and Roman deities, as was the idea of this aniconic column linking heaven and earth among early Indo-Aryans, states Roger Woodward.[86] Others contest such proposals, and suggest Shiva to have emerged from indigenous pre-Aryan tribal origins.\\n\\nRudra\\n\\nThree-headed Shiva, Gandhara, 2nd century AD\\n\\nShiva as we know him today shares many features with the Vedic god Rudra, and both Shiva and Rudra are viewed as the same personality in Hindu scriptures. The two names are used synonymously. Rudra, a Rigvedic deity with fearsome powers, was the god of the roaring storm. He is usually portrayed in accordance with the element he represents as a fierce, destructive deity. In RV 2.33, he is described as the \"Father of the Rudras\", a group of storm gods.[97][98]\\n\\nFlood notes that Rudra is an ambiguous god, peripheral in the Vedic pantheon, possibly indicating non-Vedic origins. Nevertheless, both Rudra and Shiva are akin to Wodan, the Germanic God of rage (\"wütte\") and the wild hunt.[page needed][page needed]\\n\\nAccording to Sadasivan, during the development of the Hindu synthesis attributes of the Buddha were transferred by Brahmins to Shiva, who was also linked with Rudra. The Rigveda has 3 out of 1,028 hymns dedicated to Rudra, and he finds occasional mention in other hymns of the same text. Hymn 10.92 of the Rigveda states that deity Rudra has two natures, one wild and cruel (Rudra), another that is kind and tranquil (Shiva).\\n\\nThe term Shiva also appears simply as an epithet, that means \"kind, auspicious\", one of the adjectives used to describe many different Vedic deities. While fierce ruthless natural phenomenon and storm-related Rudra is feared in the hymns of the Rigveda, the beneficial rains he brings are welcomed as Shiva aspect of him. This healing, nurturing, life-enabling aspect emerges in the Vedas as Rudra-Shiva, and in post-Vedic literature ultimately as Shiva who combines the destructive and constructive powers, the terrific and the gentle, as the ultimate recycler and rejuvenator of all existence.\\n\\nThe Vedic texts do not mention bull or any animal as the transport vehicle (vahana) of Rudra or other deities. However, post-Vedic texts such as the Mahabharata and the Puranas state the Nandi bull, the Indian zebu, in particular, as the vehicle of Rudra and of Shiva, thereby unmistakably linking them as same.\\n\\nAgni\\n\\nRudra and Agni have a close relationship.[note 3] The identification between Agni and Rudra in the Vedic literature was an important factor in the process of Rudra\\'s gradual transformation into Rudra-Shiva.[note 4] The identification of Agni with Rudra is explicitly noted in the Nirukta, an important early text on etymology, which says, \"Agni is also called Rudra.\"[107] The interconnections between the two deities are complex, and according to Stella Kramrisch:\\n\\nThe fire myth of Rudra-Śiva plays on the whole gamut of fire, valuing all its potentialities and phases, from conflagration to illumination.\\n\\nIn the Śatarudrīya, some epithets of Rudra, such as Sasipañjara (\"Of golden red hue as of flame\") and Tivaṣīmati (\"Flaming bright\"), suggest a fusing of the two deities.[note 5] Agni is said to be a bull,[109] and Shiva possesses a bull as his vehicle, Nandi. The horns of Agni, who is sometimes characterised as a bull, are mentioned.[110][111] In medieval sculpture, both Agni and the form of Shiva known as Bhairava have flaming hair as a special feature.[112]\\n\\nIndra\\n\\nPashupatinath Temple, Nepal, dedicated to Shiva as the lord of all beings\\n\\nAccording to Wendy Doniger, the Saivite fertility myths and some of the phallic characteristics of Shiva are inherited from Indra.[113] Doniger gives several reasons for her hypothesis. Both are associated with mountains, rivers, male fertility, fierceness, fearlessness, warfare, the transgression of established mores, the Aum sound, the Supreme Self. In the Rig Veda the term śiva is used to refer to Indra. (2.20.3,[note 6] 6.45.17,[115][116] and 8.93.3.[117]) Indra, like Shiva, is likened to a bull.[118][119] In the Rig Veda, Rudra is the father of the Maruts, but he is never associated with their warlike exploits as is Indra.[120]\\n\\nIndra himself may have been adopted by the Vedic Aryans from the Bactria–Margiana Culture. According to Anthony,\\n\\nMany of the qualities of Indo-Iranian god of might/victory, Verethraghna, were transferred to the adopted god Indra, who became the central deity of the developing Old Indic culture. Indra was the subject of 250 hymns, a quarter of the Rig Veda. He was associated more than any other deity with Soma, a stimulant drug (perhaps derived from Ephedra) probably borrowed from the BMAC religion. His rise to prominence was a peculiar trait of the Old Indic speakers.\\n\\nThe texts and artwork of Jainism show Indra as a dancer, although not identical generally resembling the dancing Shiva artwork found in Hinduism, particularly in their respective mudras. For example, in the Jain caves at Ellora, extensive carvings show dancing Indra next to the images of Tirthankaras in a manner similar to Shiva Nataraja. The similarities in the dance iconography suggests that there may be a link between ancient Indra and Shiva.\\n\\nDevelopment\\n\\nA few texts such as Atharvashiras Upanishad mention Rudra, and assert all gods are Rudra, everyone and everything is Rudra, and Rudra is the principle found in all things, their highest goal, the innermost essence of all reality that is visible or invisible. The Kaivalya Upanishad similarly, states Paul Deussen – a German Indologist and professor of philosophy, describes the self-realized man as who \"feels himself only as the one divine essence that lives in all\", who feels identity of his and everyone\\'s consciousness with Shiva (highest Atman), who has found this highest Atman within, in the depths of his heart.\\n\\nRudra\\'s evolution from a minor Vedic deity to a supreme being is first evidenced in the Shvetashvatara Upanishad (400–200 BCE), according to Gavin Flood, presenting the earliest seeds of theistic devotion to Rudra-Shiva. Here Rudra-Shiva is identified as the creator of the cosmos and liberator of Selfs from the birth-rebirth cycle. The Svetasvatara Upanishad set the tone for early Shaivite thought, especially in chapter 3 verse 2 where Shiva is equated with Brahman: \"Rudra is truly one; for the knowers of Brahman do not admit the existence of a second\".[128][129] The period of 200 BC to 100 AD also marks the beginning of the Shaiva tradition focused on the worship of Shiva as evidenced in other literature of this period. Other scholars such as Robert Hume and Doris Srinivasan state that the Shvetashvatara Upanishad presents pluralism, pantheism, or henotheism, rather than being a text just on Shiva theism.\\n\\nSelf-realization and Shaiva Upanishads He who sees himself in all beings,\\n\\nAnd all beings in him,\\n\\nattains the highest Brahman,\\n\\nnot by any other means. —Kaivalya Upanishad 10\\n\\nShaiva devotees and ascetics are mentioned in Patanjali\\'s Mahābhāṣya (2nd-century BCE) and in the Mahabharata.[133]\\n\\nThe earliest iconic artworks of Shiva may be from Gandhara and northwest parts of ancient India. There is some uncertainty as the artwork that has survived is damaged and they show some overlap with meditative Buddha-related artwork, but the presence of Shiva\\'s trident and phallic symbolism[note 2] in this art suggests it was likely Shiva. Numismatics research suggests that numerous coins of the ancient Kushan Empire (30–375 CE) that have survived, were images of a god who is probably Shiva. The Shiva in Kushan coins is referred to as Oesho of unclear etymology and origins, but the simultaneous presence of Indra and Shiva in the Kushan era artwork suggest that they were revered deities by the start of the Kushan Empire.[136]\\n\\nThe Shaiva Upanishads are a group of 14 minor Upanishads of Hinduism variously dated from the last centuries of the 1st millennium BCE through the 17th century. These extol Shiva as the metaphysical unchanging reality Brahman and the Atman (Self), and include sections about rites and symbolisms related to Shiva.\\n\\nThe Shaiva Puranas, particularly the Shiva Purana and the Linga Purana, present the various aspects of Shiva, mythologies, cosmology and pilgrimage (Tirtha) associated with him. The Shiva-related Tantra literature, composed between the 8th and 11th centuries, are regarded in devotional dualistic Shaivism as Sruti. Dualistic Shaiva Agamas which consider Self within each living being and Shiva as two separate realities (dualism, dvaita), are the foundational texts for Shaiva Siddhanta. Other Shaiva Agamas teach that these are one reality (monism, advaita), and that Shiva is the Self, the perfection and truth within each living being.[142] In Shiva related sub-traditions, there are ten dualistic Agama texts, eighteen qualified monism-cum-dualism Agama texts and sixty-four monism Agama texts.[143][144]\\n\\nShiva-related literature developed extensively across India in the 1st millennium CE and through the 13th century, particularly in Kashmir and Tamil Shaiva traditions. Shaivism gained immense popularity in Tamilakam as early as the 7th century CE, with poets such as Appar and Sambandar composing rich poetry that is replete with present features associated with the deity, such as his tandava dance, the mulavam (dumru), the aspect of holding fire, and restraining the proud flow of the Ganga upon his braid.[146] The monist Shiva literature posit absolute oneness, that is Shiva is within every man and woman, Shiva is within every living being, Shiva is present everywhere in the world including all non-living being, and there is no spiritual difference between life, matter, man and Shiva. The various dualistic and monist Shiva-related ideas were welcomed in medieval southeast Asia, inspiring numerous Shiva-related temples, artwork and texts in Indonesia, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia, with syncretic integration of local pre-existing theologies.\\n\\nPosition within Hinduism\\n\\nLingodbhava is a Shaiva sectarian icon where Shiva is depicted rising from the Lingam (an infinite fiery pillar) that narrates how Shiva is the foremost of the Trimurti; Brahma on the left and Vishnu on the right are depicted bowing to Shiva in the centre.\\n\\nShaivism\\n\\nShaivism is one of the four major sects of Hinduism, the others being Vaishnavism, Shaktism and the Smarta Tradition. Followers of Shaivism, called \"Shaivas\", revere Shiva as the Supreme Being. Shaivas believe that Shiva is All and in all, the creator, preserver, destroyer, revealer and concealer of all that is. He is not only the creator in Shaivism, but he is also the creation that results from him, he is everything and everywhere. Shiva is the primal Self, the pure consciousness and Absolute Reality in the Shaiva traditions. Shiva is also part of \\'Om\\' (ॐ) as a \\'U\\' (उ).[149]\\n\\nThe Shaivism theology is broadly grouped into two: the popular theology influenced by Shiva-Rudra in the Vedas, Epics and the Puranas; and the esoteric theology influenced by the Shiva and Shakti-related Tantra texts. The Vedic-Brahmanic Shiva theology includes both monist (Advaita) and devotional traditions (Dvaita), such as Tamil Shaiva Siddhanta and Lingayatism. Shiva temples feature items such as linga, Shiva-Parvati iconography, bull Nandi within the premises, and relief artwork showing aspects of Shiva.[152]\\n\\nThe Tantric Shiva (\"शिव\") tradition ignored the mythologies and Puranas related to Shiva, and depending on the sub-school developed a variety of practices. For example, historical records suggest the tantric Kapalikas (literally, the \\'skull-men\\') co-existed with and shared many Vajrayana Buddhist rituals, engaged in esoteric practices that revered Shiva and Shakti wearing skulls, begged with empty skulls, and sometimes used meat as a part of ritual.[153] In contrast, the esoteric tradition within Kashmir Shaivism has featured the Krama and Trika sub-traditions.[154] The Krama sub-tradition focussed on esoteric rituals around Shiva-Kali pair.[155] The Trika sub-tradition developed a theology of triads involving Shiva, combined it with an ascetic lifestyle focusing on personal Shiva in the pursuit of monistic self-liberation.[154][157]\\n\\nVaishnavism\\n\\nThe Vaishnava (Vishnu-oriented) literature acknowledges and discusses Shiva. Like Shaiva literature that presents Shiva as supreme, the Vaishnava literature presents Vishnu as supreme. However, both traditions are pluralistic and revere both Shiva and Vishnu (along with Devi), their texts do not show exclusivism, and Vaishnava texts such as the Bhagavata Purana while praising Krishna as the Ultimate Reality, also present Shiva and Shakti as a personalised form an equivalent to the same Ultimate Reality.[158][159][160] The texts of Shaivism tradition similarly praise Vishnu. The Skanda Purana, for example, states:\\n\\nVishnu is no one but Shiva, and he who is called Shiva is but identical with Vishnu. Skanda Purana, 1.8.20–21 [ 161 ]\\n\\nBoth traditions include legends about who is superior, about Shiva paying homage to Vishnu, and Vishnu paying homage to Shiva. However, in texts and artwork of either tradition, the mutual salutes are symbolism for complementarity.[162] The Mahabharata declares the unchanging Ultimate Reality (Brahman) to be identical to Shiva and to Vishnu,[163] that Vishnu is the highest manifestation of Shiva, and Shiva is the highest manifestation of Vishnu.[164]\\n\\nShaktism\\n\\nArdhanarishvara sculpture, Khajuraho, depicting Shiva with goddess Parvati as his equal half. In the Ardhanarisvara concept, the icon is presented as half-man and half woman.\\n\\nThe goddess-oriented Shakti tradition of Hinduism is based on the premise that the Supreme Principle and the Ultimate Reality called Brahman is female (Devi), but it treats the male as her equal and complementary partner. This partner is Shiva.\\n\\nThe earliest evidence of the tradition of reverence for the feminine with Rudra-Shiva context, is found in the Hindu scripture Rigveda, in a hymn called the Devi Sukta.[174]\\n\\nThe Devi Upanishad in its explanation of the theology of Shaktism, mentions and praises Shiva such as in its verse 19. Shiva, along with Vishnu, is a revered god in the Devi Mahatmya, a text of Shaktism considered by the tradition to be as important as the Bhagavad Gita.[178] The Ardhanarisvara concept co-mingles god Shiva and goddess Shakti by presenting an icon that is half-man and half woman, a representation and theme of union found in many Hindu texts and temples.[179][180]\\n\\nSmarta tradition\\n\\nOleograph by Raja Ravi Varma depicting a Shiva-centric Panchayatana. A bearded Shiva sits in the centre with his wife Parvati and their infant son Ganesha; surrounded by (clockwise from left upper corner) Ganesha, Devi, Vishnu, and Surya. Shiva\\'s mount is the bull Nandi below Shiva.\\n\\nIn the Smarta tradition of Hinduism, Shiva is a part of its Panchayatana puja.[181] This practice consists of the use of icons or anicons of five deities considered equivalent,[181] set in a quincunx pattern.[182] Shiva is one of the five deities, others being Vishnu, Devi (such as Parvati), Surya and Ganesha or Skanda or any personal god of devotee\\'s preference (Ishta Devata).\\n\\nPhilosophically, the Smarta tradition emphasises that all idols (murti) are icons to help focus on and visualise aspects of Brahman, rather than distinct beings. The ultimate goal in this practice is to transition past the use of icons, recognise the Absolute symbolised by the icons,[184] on the path to realising the nondual identity of one\\'s Atman (Self) and the Brahman.[185] Popularized by Adi Shankara, many Panchayatana mandalas and temples have been uncovered that are from the Gupta Empire period, and one Panchayatana set from the village of Nand (about 24 kilometres from Ajmer) has been dated to belong to the Kushan Empire era (pre-300 CE). The Kushan period set includes Shiva, Vishnu, Surya, Brahma and one deity whose identity is unclear.\\n\\nYoga\\n\\nShiva is considered the Great Yogi who is totally absorbed in himself – the transcendental reality. He is the Lord of Yogis, and the teacher of Yoga to sages. As Shiva Dakshinamurthi, states Stella Kramrisch, he is the supreme guru who \"teaches in silence the oneness of one\\'s innermost self (atman) with the ultimate reality (Brahman).\" Shiva is also an archetype for samhara (Sanskrit: संहार) or dissolution which includes transcendence of human misery by the dissolution of maya, which is why Shiva is associated with Yoga.[189][190]\\n\\nAdiyogi Shiva (the first Yogi) statue in Coimbatore\\n\\nThe theory and practice of Yoga, in different styles, has been a part of all major traditions of Hinduism, and Shiva has been the patron or spokesperson in numerous Hindu Yoga texts.[191][192] These contain the philosophy and techniques for Yoga. These ideas are estimated to be from or after the late centuries of the 1st millennium CE, and have survived as Yoga texts such as the Isvara Gita (literally, \\'Shiva\\'s song\\'), which Andrew Nicholson – a professor of Hinduism and Indian Intellectual History – states have had \"a profound and lasting influence on the development of Hinduism\".[193]\\n\\nOther famed Shiva-related texts influenced Hatha Yoga, integrated monistic (Advaita Vedanta) ideas with Yoga philosophy and inspired the theoretical development of Indian classical dance. These include the Shiva Sutras, the Shiva Samhita, and those by the scholars of Kashmir Shaivism such as the 10th-century scholar Abhinavagupta.[191][192][194] Abhinavagupta writes in his notes on the relevance of ideas related to Shiva and Yoga, by stating that \"people, occupied as they are with their own affairs, normally do nothing for others\", and Shiva and Yoga spirituality helps one look beyond, understand interconnectedness, and thus benefit both the individual and the world towards a more blissful state of existence.[195]\\n\\nTrimurti\\n\\nThe Trimurti is a concept in Hinduism in which the cosmic functions of creation, maintenance, and destruction are personified by the forms of Brahma the creator, Vishnu the maintainer or preserver and Shiva the destroyer or transformer.[196][197] These three deities have been called \"the Hindu triad\"[198] or the \"Great Triple deity\".[199] However, the ancient and medieval texts of Hinduism feature many triads of gods and goddesses, some of which do not include Shiva.[200]\\n\\nAttributes\\n\\nShiva with Parvati. Shiva is depicted three-eyed, the Ganges flowing through his matted hair, wearing ornaments of serpents and a skull garland, covered in ashes, and seated on a tiger skin.\\n\\nA seated Shiva holds an axe and deer in his hands.\\n\\nSiva with Moustache from Archaeological Museum GOA.\\n\\nForms and depictions\\n\\nShiva is often depicted as embodying attributes of ambiguity and paradox. His depictions are marked by the opposing themes including fierceness and innocence. This duality can be seen in the diverse epithets attributed to him and the rich tapestry of narratives that delineate his persona within Hindu mythology.[248]\\n\\nDestroyer and Benefactor\\n\\n[ 249 ] Left: Shiva is represented in his many aspects.Left: Bhairava icon of the fierce form of Shiva, 16th century Nepal; right: Shiva as a meditating yogi in Rishikesh\\n\\nIn Yajurveda, two contrary sets of attributes for both malignant or terrifying (Sanskrit: rudra) and benign or auspicious (Sanskrit: śiva) forms can be found, leading Chakravarti to conclude that \"all the basic elements which created the complex Rudra-Śiva sect of later ages are to be found here\".[250] In the Mahabharata, Shiva is depicted as \"the standard of invincibility, might, and terror\", as well as a figure of honour, delight, and brilliance.[251]\\n\\nThe duality of Shiva\\'s fearful and auspicious attributes appears in contrasted names. The name Rudra reflects Shiva\\'s fearsome aspects. According to traditional etymologies, the Sanskrit name Rudra is derived from the root rud-, which means \"to cry, howl\".[252] Stella Kramrisch notes a different etymology connected with the adjectival form raudra, which means \"wild, of rudra nature\", and translates the name Rudra as \"the wild one\" or \"the fierce god\".[253] R. K. Sharma follows this alternate etymology and translates the name as \"terrible\". Hara is an important name that occurs three times in the Anushasanaparvan version of the Shiva sahasranama, where it is translated in different ways each time it occurs, following a commentorial tradition of not repeating an interpretation. Sharma translates the three as \"one who captivates\", \"one who consolidates\", and \"one who destroys\". Kramrisch translates it as \"the ravisher\". Another of Shiva\\'s fearsome forms is as Kāla \"time\" and Mahākāla \"great time\", which ultimately destroys all things. The name Kāla appears in the Shiva Sahasranama, where it is translated by Ram Karan Sharma as \"(the Supreme Lord of) Time\". Bhairava \"terrible\" or \"frightful\" is a fierce form associated with annihilation. In contrast, the name Śaṇkara, \"beneficent\" or \"conferring happiness\" reflects his benign form. This name was adopted by the great Vedanta philosopher Adi Shankara ( c. 788 – c. 820), who is also known as Shankaracharya. The name Śambhu (Sanskrit: शम्भु swam-on its own; bhu-burn/shine) \"self-shining/ shining on its own\", also reflects this benign aspect.\\n\\nAscetic and householder\\n\\nShiva is depicted both as an ascetic mendicant (left as Bhikshatana ) and as a householder with his wife Parvati and sons Ganesha and Kartikeya (right).\\n\\nShiva is depicted as both an ascetic yogi and as a householder (grihasta), roles which have been traditionally mutually exclusive in Hindu society.[261] When depicted as a yogi, he may be shown sitting and meditating.[262] His epithet Mahāyogi (\"the great Yogi: Mahā = \"great\", Yogi = \"one who practices Yoga\") refers to his association with yoga.[263] While Vedic religion was conceived mainly in terms of sacrifice, it was during the Epic period that the concepts of tapas, yoga, and asceticism became more important, and the depiction of Shiva as an ascetic sitting in philosophical isolation reflects these later concepts.[264]\\n\\nAs a family man and householder, he has a wife, Parvati, and two sons, Ganesha and Kartikeya. His epithet Umāpati (\"The husband of Umā\") refers to this idea, and Sharma notes that two other variants of this name that mean the same thing, Umākānta and Umādhava, also appear in the sahasranama.[265] Umā in epic literature is known by many names, including the benign Pārvatī.[266][267] She is identified with Devi, the Divine Mother; Shakti (divine energy) as well as goddesses like Tripura Sundari, Durga, Kali, Kamakshi and Minakshi. The consorts of Shiva are the source of his creative energy. They represent the dynamic extension of Shiva onto this universe.[268] His son Ganesha is worshipped throughout India and Nepal as the Remover of Obstacles, Lord of Beginnings and Lord of Obstacles. Kartikeya is worshipped in Southern India (especially in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka) by the names Subrahmanya, Subrahmanyan, Shanmughan, Swaminathan and Murugan, and in Northern India by the names Skanda, Kumara, or Karttikeya.[269]\\n\\nSome regional deities are also identified as Shiva\\'s children. As one story goes, Shiva is enticed by the beauty and charm of Mohini, Vishnu\\'s female avatar, and procreates with her. As a result of this union, Shasta – identified with regional deities Ayyappan and Aiyanar – is born.[270][271][272][273] In outskirts of Ernakulam in Kerala, a deity named Vishnumaya is stated to be offspring of Shiva and invoked in local exorcism rites, but this deity is not traceable in Hindu pantheon and is possibly a local tradition with \"vaguely Chinese\" style rituals, states Saletore.[274] In some traditions, Shiva has daughters like the serpent-goddess Manasa and Ashokasundari.[276] According to Doniger, two regional stories depict demons Andhaka and Jalandhara as the children of Shiva who war with him, and are later destroyed by Shiva.[277]\\n\\nIconographic forms\\n\\nThe depiction of Shiva as Nataraja (Sanskrit नटराज; Naṭarāja) is a form (mūrti) of Shiva as \"Lord of Dance\".[278][279] The names Nartaka (\"dancer\") and Nityanarta (\"eternal dancer\") appear in the Shiva Sahasranama.[280] His association with dance and also with music is prominent in the Puranic period.[281] In addition to the specific iconographic form known as Nataraja, various other types of dancing forms (Sanskrit: nṛtyamūrti) are found in all parts of India, with many well-defined varieties in Tamil Nadu in particular.[282] The two most common forms of the dance are the Tandava, which later came to denote the powerful and masculine dance as Kala-Mahakala associated with the destruction of the world. When it requires the world or universe to be destroyed, Shiva does it by the Tandava, and Lasya, which is graceful and delicate and expresses emotions on a gentle level and is considered the feminine dance attributed to the goddess Parvati.[284][285] Lasya is regarded as the female counterpart of Tandava.[285] The Tandava-Lasya dances are associated with the destruction-creation of the world.[286][287][288]\\n\\nDakshinamurti (Sanskrit दक्षिणामूर्ति; Dakṣiṇāmūrti, \"[facing] south form\")[289] represents Shiva in his aspect as a teacher of yoga, music, and wisdom and giving exposition on the shastras.[290] Dakshinamurti is depicted as a figure seated upon a deer-throne surrounded by sages receiving instruction.[291] Dakshinamurti\\'s depiction in Indian art is mostly restricted to Tamil Nadu.[292]\\n\\nBhikshatana (Sanskrit भिक्षाटन; Bhikṣāṭana, \"wandering about for alms, mendicancy\"[293]) depicts Shiva as a divine medicant. He is depicted as a nude four-armed man adorned with ornaments who holds a begging bowl in his hand and is followed by demonic attendants. He is associated with his penance for committing brahmicide as Bhirava and with his encounters with the sages and their wives in the Deodar forest.\\n\\nTripurantaka (Sanskrit त्रिपुरांतक; Tripurāntaka, \"ender of Tripura\" ) is associated with his destruction of the three cities (Tripura) of the Asuras.[295] He is depicted with four arms, the upper pair holding an axe and a deer, and the lower pair wielding a bow and arrow.\\n\\nArdhanarishvara (Sanskrit: अर्धनारीश्वर; Ardhanārīśvara, \"the lord who is half woman\"[296]) is conjunct form of Shiva with Parvati. Adhanarishvara is depicted with one half of the body as male and the other half as female. Ardhanarishvara represents the synthesis of masculine and feminine energies of the universe (Purusha and Prakriti) and illustrates how Shakti, the female principle of God, is inseparable from (or the same as, according to some interpretations) Shiva, the male principle of God, and vice versa.[297]\\n\\nKalyanasundara-murti (Sanskrit कल्याणसुन्दर-मूर्ति, literally \"icon of beautiful marriage\") is the depiction of Shiva\\'s marriage to Parvati. The divine couple are often depicted performing the panigrahana (Sanskrit \"accepting the hand\") ritual from traditional Hindu wedding ceremonies.[298] The most basic form of this murti consists of only Shiva and Parvati together, but in more elaborate forms they are accompanied by other persons, sometimes including Parvati\\'s parents, as well as deities (often with Vishnu and Lakshmi standing as Parvati\\'s parents, Brahma as the officiating priest, and various other deities as attendants or guests).\\n\\nSomaskanda is the depiction of Shiva, Parvati, and their son Skanda (Kartikeya), popular during the Pallava Dynasty in southern India.\\n\\nAstamurti (Sanskrit: अष्टमूर्ति) is an iconographic depiction of Shiva as composed of eight attributes: Rudra, Śarva, Paśupati, Ugra, Aśani, Bhava, Mahādeva, and Īśāna—some of which overlap with Pañcānana, described below.\\n\\nPañcānana (Sanskrit: पञ्चानन), also called the pañcabrahma, is a form of Shiva depicting him as having five faces which correspond to his five divine activities (pañcakṛtya): creation (sṛṣṭi), preservation (sthithi), destruction (saṃhāra), concealing grace (tirobhāva), and revealing grace (anugraha). Five is a sacred number for Shiva.[299] One of his most important mantras has five syllables (namaḥ śivāya).[300]\\n\\nThe 10th century five headed Shiva, Sadashiva, Cambodia\\n\\nShiva\\'s body is said to consist of five mantras, called the pañcabrahman.[301] As forms of God, each of these have their own names and distinct iconography:[302] These are represented as the five faces of Shiva and are associated in various texts with the five elements, the five senses, the five organs of perception, and the five organs of action.[303][304] Doctrinal differences and, possibly, errors in transmission, have resulted in some differences between texts in details of how these five forms are linked with various attributes.[305] The overall meaning of these associations is summarised by Stella Kramrisch,\\n\\nThrough these transcendent categories, Śiva, the ultimate reality, becomes the efficient and material cause of all that exists.\\n\\nAccording to the Pañcabrahma Upanishad:\\n\\nOne should know all things of the phenomenal world as of a fivefold character, for the reason that the eternal verity of Śiva is of the character of the fivefold Brahman. (Pañcabrahma Upanishad 31)[307]\\n\\nIn the hymn of Manikkavacakar\\'s Thiruvasagam, he testifies that Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram had, by the pre-Chola period, an abstract or \\'cosmic\\' symbolism linked to five elements (Pancha Bhoota) including ether. Nataraja is a significant visual interpretation of Brahman and a dance posture of Shiva.[309] Sharada Srinivasan notes that, Nataraja is described as Satcitananda or \"Being, Consciousness and Bliss\" in the Shaiva Siddhanta text Kunchitangrim Bhaje, resembling the Advaita doctrine, or \"abstract monism,\" of Adi Shankara, \"which holds the individual Self (Jīvātman) and supream Self (Paramātmā) to be one,\" while \"an earlier hymn to Nataraja by Manikkavachakar identifies him with the unitary supreme consciousness, by using Tamil word Or Unarve, rather than Sanskrit Chit.\" This may point to an \"osmosis\" of ideas in medieval India, states Srinivasan.\\n\\nLingam\\n\\nThe Linga Purana states, \"Shiva is signless, without color, taste, smell, that is beyond word or touch, without quality, motionless and changeless\".[311] The source of the universe is the signless, and all of the universe is the manifested Linga, a union of unchanging Principles and the ever changing nature.[311] The Linga Purana and the Shiva Gita texts builds on this foundation.[313] Linga, states Alain Daniélou, means sign.[311] It is an important concept in Hindu texts, wherein Linga is a manifested sign and nature of someone or something. It accompanies the concept of Brahman, which as invisible signless and existent Principle, is formless or linga-less.[311]\\n\\nThe Shvetashvatara Upanishad states one of the three significations, the primary one, of Lingam as \"the imperishable Purusha\", the absolute reality, where says the linga as \"sign\", a mark that provides the existence of Brahman, thus the original meaning as \"sign\". Furthermore, it says \"Shiva, the Supreme Lord, has no liūga\", liuga (Sanskrit: लिऊग IAST: liūga) meaning Shiva is transcendent, beyond any characteristic and, specifically the sign of gender.\\n\\nApart from anthropomorphic images of Shiva, he is also represented in aniconic form of a lingam. These are depicted in various designs. One common form is the shape of a vertical rounded column in the centre of a lipped, disk-shaped object, the yoni, symbolism for the goddess Shakti.[316] In Shiva temples, the linga is typically present in its sanctum sanctorum and is the focus of votary offerings such as milk, water, flower petals, fruit, fresh leaves, and rice.[316] According to Monier Williams and Yudit Greenberg, linga literally means \\'mark, sign or emblem\\', and also refers to a \"mark or sign from which the existence of something else can be reliably inferred\". It implies the regenerative divine energy innate in nature, symbolised by Shiva.[317][318]\\n\\nSome scholars, such as Wendy Doniger, view linga as merely a phallic symbol,[319][320][321][322] although this interpretation is criticised by others, including Swami Vivekananda,[323] Sivananda Saraswati,[324] Stella Kramrisch, Swami Agehananda Bharati,[326] S. N. Balagangadhara,[327] and others.[327][328][329][330] According to Moriz Winternitz, the linga in the Shiva tradition is \"only a symbol of the productive and creative principle of nature as embodied in Shiva\", and it has no historical trace in any obscene phallic cult.[331] According to Sivananda Saraswati, westerners who are curiously passionate and have impure understanding or intelligence, incorrectly assume Siva Linga as a phallus or sex organ.[324] Later on, Sivananda Saraswati mentions that, this is not only a serious mistake, but also a grave blunder.[324]\\n\\nThe worship of the lingam originated from the famous hymn in the Atharva-Veda Samhitâ sung in praise of the Yupa-Stambha, the sacrificial post. In that hymn, a description is found of the beginningless and endless Stambha or Skambha, and it is shown that the said Skambha is put in place of the eternal Brahman. Just as the Yajna (sacrificial) fire, its smoke, ashes, and flames, the Soma plant, and the ox that used to carry on its back the wood for the Vedic sacrifice gave place to the conceptions of the brightness of Shiva\\'s body, his tawny matted hair, his blue throat, and the riding on the bull of the Shiva, the Yupa-Skambha gave place in time to the Shiva-Linga.[332][333] In the text Linga Purana, the same hymn is expanded in the shape of stories, meant to establish the glory of the great Stambha and the superiority of Shiva as Mahadeva.[333]\\n\\nThe oldest known archaeological linga as an icon of Shiva is the Gudimallam lingam from 3rd-century BCE.[316] In Shaivism pilgrimage tradition, twelve major temples of Shiva are called Jyotirlinga, which means \"linga of light\", and these are located across India.[334]\\n\\nAvatars\\n\\nPuranic scriptures contain occasional references to \"ansh\" – literally \\'portion, or avatars of Shiva\\', but the idea of Shiva avatars is not universally accepted in Shaivism.[335] The Linga Purana mentions twenty-eight forms of Shiva which are sometimes seen as avatars,[336] however such mention is unusual and the avatars of Shiva is relatively rare in Shaivism compared to the well emphasised concept of Vishnu avatars in Vaishnavism.[337][339] Some Vaishnava literature reverentially link Shiva to characters in its Puranas. For example, in the Hanuman Chalisa, Hanuman is identified as the eleventh avatar of Shiva.[340][341][342] The Bhagavata Purana and the Vishnu Purana claim sage Durvasa to be a portion of Shiva.[345] Some medieval era writers have called the Advaita Vedanta philosopher Adi Shankara an incarnation of Shiva.[346]\\n\\nTemple\\n\\nFestivals\\n\\nMaha Shivaratri festival is observed in the night, usually in lighted temples or special prabha (above).\\n\\nThere is a Shivaratri in every lunar month on its 13th night/14th day,[347] but once a year in late winter (February/March) and before the arrival of spring, marks Maha Shivaratri which means \"the Great Night of Shiva\".\\n\\nMaha Shivaratri is a major Hindu festival, but one that is solemn and theologically marks a remembrance of \"overcoming darkness and ignorance\" in life and the world, and meditation about the polarities of existence, of Shiva and a devotion to humankind.[347] It is observed by reciting Shiva-related poems, chanting prayers, remembering Shiva, fasting, doing Yoga and meditating on ethics and virtues such as self-restraint, honesty, noninjury to others, forgiveness, introspection, self-repentance and the discovery of Shiva. The ardent devotees keep awake all night. Others visit one of the Shiva temples or go on pilgrimage to Jyotirlingam shrines. Those who visit temples, offer milk, fruits, flowers, fresh leaves and sweets to the lingam. Some communities organise special dance events, to mark Shiva as the lord of dance, with individual and group performances.[351] According to Jones and Ryan, Maha Sivaratri is an ancient Hindu festival which probably originated around the 5th-century.\\n\\nAnother major festival involving Shiva worship is Kartik Purnima, commemorating Shiva\\'s victory over the three demons known as Tripurasura. Across India, various Shiva temples are illuminated throughout the night. Shiva icons are carried in procession in some places.[352]\\n\\nThiruvathira is a festival observed in Kerala dedicated to Shiva. It is believed that on this day, Parvati met Shiva after her long penance and Shiva took her as his wife.[353] On this day Hindu women performs the Thiruvathirakali accompanied by Thiruvathira paattu (folk songs about Parvati and her longing and penance for Shiva\\'s affection).[354]\\n\\nRegional festivals dedicated to Shiva include the Chithirai festival in Madurai around April/May, one of the largest festivals in South India, celebrating the wedding of Minakshi (Parvati) and Shiva. The festival is one where both the Vaishnava and Shaiva communities join the celebrations, because Vishnu gives away his sister Minakshi in marriage to Shiva.\\n\\nSome Shaktism-related festivals revere Shiva along with the goddess considered primary and Supreme. These include festivals dedicated to Annapurna such as Annakuta and those related to Durga. In Himalayan regions such as Nepal, as well as in northern, central and western India, the festival of Teej is celebrated by girls and women in the monsoon season, in honour of goddess Parvati, with group singing, dancing and by offering prayers in Parvati-Shiva temples.[357][358]\\n\\nThe ascetic, Vedic and Tantric sub-traditions related to Shiva, such as those that became ascetic warriors during the Islamic rule period of India,[359][360] celebrate the Kumbha Mela festival. This festival cycles every 12 years, in four pilgrimage sites within India, with the event moving to the next site after a gap of three years. The biggest is in Prayaga (renamed Allahabad during the Mughal rule era), where millions of Hindus of different traditions gather at the confluence of rivers Ganges and Yamuna. In the Hindu tradition, the Shiva-linked ascetic warriors (Nagas) get the honour of starting the event by entering the Sangam first for bathing and prayers.\\n\\nIn Pakistan, major Shivaratri celebration occurs at the Umarkot Shiv Mandir in the Umarkot. The three-day Shivarathri celebration at the temple is attended by around 250,000 people.[362]\\n\\nBeyond the Indian subcontinent and Hinduism\\n\\nIndonesia\\n\\nIn Indonesian Shaivism the popular name for Shiva has been Batara Guru, which is derived from Sanskrit Bhattāraka which means \"noble lord\". He is conceptualised as a kind spiritual teacher, the first of all Gurus in Indonesian Hindu texts, mirroring the Dakshinamurti aspect of Shiva in the Indian subcontinent. However, the Batara Guru has more aspects than the Indian Shiva, as the Indonesian Hindus blended their spirits and heroes with him. Batara Guru\\'s wife in Southeast Asia is the same Hindu deity Durga, who has been popular since ancient times, and she too has a complex character with benevolent and fierce manifestations, each visualised with different names such as Uma, Sri, Kali and others.[365] In contrast to Hindu religious texts, whether Vedas or Puranas, in Javanese puppetry (wayang) books, Batara Guru is the king of the gods who regulates and creates the world system. In the classic book that is used as a reference for the puppeteers, it is said that Sanghyang Manikmaya or Batara Guru was created from a sparkling light by Sang Hyang Tunggal, along with the blackish light which is the origin of Ismaya.[367][368] Shiva has been called Sadāśiva, Paramasiva, Mahādeva in benevolent forms, and Kāla, Bhairava, Mahākāla in his fierce forms.\\n\\nThe Indonesian Hindu texts present the same philosophical diversity of Shaivite traditions found in the Indian subcontinent. However, among the texts that have survived into the contemporary era, the more common are of those of Shaiva Siddhanta (locally also called Siwa Siddhanta, Sridanta).\\n\\nDuring the pre-Islamic period on the island of Java, Shaivism and Buddhism were considered very close and allied religions, though not identical religions. The medieval-era Indonesian literature equates Buddha with Siwa (Shiva) and Janardana (Vishnu).[371] This tradition continues in predominantly Hindu Bali Indonesia in the modern era, where Buddha is considered the younger brother of Shiva.\\n\\nCentral Asia\\n\\nThe worship of Shiva became popular in Central Asia through the influence of the Hephthalite Empire[373] and Kushan Empire. Shaivism was also popular in Sogdia and the Kingdom of Yutian as found from the wall painting from Penjikent on the river Zervashan.[374] In this depiction, Shiva is portrayed with a sacred halo and a sacred thread (Yajnopavita).[374] He is clad in tiger skin while his attendants are wearing Sogdian dress.[374] A panel from Dandan Oilik shows Shiva in His Trimurti form with Shakti kneeling on her right thigh.[374][375] Another site in the Taklamakan Desert depicts him with four legs, seated cross-legged on a cushioned seat supported by two bulls.[374] It is also noted that the Zoroastrian wind god Vayu-Vata took on the iconographic appearance of Shiva.[375]\\n\\nSikhism\\n\\nThe Japuji Sahib of the Guru Granth Sahib says: \"The Guru is Shiva, the Guru is Vishnu and Brahma; the Guru is Paarvati and Lakhshmi.\"[376] In the same chapter, it also says: \"Shiva speaks, and the Siddhas listen.\" In Dasam Granth, Guru Gobind Singh has mentioned two avatars of Rudra: Dattatreya Avatar and Parasnath Avatar.[377]\\n\\nBuddhism\\n\\nMahakala, c. 1500 CE Tibetan Thangka\\n\\nShiva is mentioned in the Buddhist Tantras and worshipped as the fierce deity Mahākāla in Vajrayana, Chinese Esoteric, and Tibetan Buddhism.[378] In the cosmologies of Buddhist Tantras, Shiva is depicted as passive, with Shakti being his active counterpart: Shiva as Prajña and Shakti as Upāya.[379][380]\\n\\nIn Mahayana Buddhism, Shiva is depicted as Maheshvara, a deva living in Akanishta Devaloka. In Theravada Buddhism, Shiva is depicted as Ishana, a deva residing in the 6th heaven of Kamadhatu along with Sakra Indra. In Vajrayana Buddhism, Shiva is depicted as Mahakala, a dharma protecting Bodhisattva. In most forms of Buddhism, the position of Shiva is lesser than that of Mahabrahma or Sakra Indra. In Mahayana Buddhist texts, Shiva (Maheshvara) becomes a buddha called Bhasmeshvara Buddha (\"Buddha of ashes\").[381]\\n\\nPaintings of Shiva and Parvati in Kizil Caves Xinjiang , China. The two are at the bottom right of the bottom image\\n\\nIn China and Taiwan, Shiva, better known there as Maheśvara (Chinese: 大自在天; pinyin: Dàzìzàitiān; or Chinese: 摩醯首羅天 pinyin: Móxīshǒuluótiān) is considered one of the Twenty Devas (Chinese: 二十諸天, pinyin: Èrshí Zhūtiān) or the Twenty-Four Devas (Chinese: 二十四諸天, pinyin: Èrshísì zhūtiān) who are a group of dharmapalas that manifest to protect the Buddhist dharma.[382] Statues of him are often enshrined in the Mahavira Halls of Chinese Buddhist temples along with the other devas. In Kizil Caves in Xinjiang, there are numerous caves that depict Shiva in the buddhist shrines through wall paintings.[383][384][385] In addition, he is also regarded as one of thirty-three manifestations of Avalokitesvara in the Lotus Sutra.[386] In Mahayana Buddhist cosmology, Maheśvara resides in Akaniṣṭha, highest of the Śuddhāvāsa (\"Pure Abodes\") wherein Anāgāmi (\"Non-returners\") who are already on the path to Arhathood and who will attain enlightenment are born.\\n\\nDaikokuten, one of the Seven Lucky Gods in Japan, is considered to be evolved from Shiva. The god enjoys an exalted position as a household deity in Japan and is worshipped as the god of wealth and fortune.[387] The name is the Japanese equivalent of Mahākāla, the Buddhist name for Shiva.[388]\\n\\nIn popular culture\\n\\nIn contemporary culture, Shiva is depicted in art, films, and books. He has been referred to as \"the god of cool things\"[391] and a \"bonafide rock hero\".[392] One popular film was the 1967 Kannada movie Gange Gowri.[393]\\n\\nA 1990s television series of DD National titled Om Namah Shivay was also based on legends of Shiva.[394] Amish Tripathi\\'s 2010 book Shiva Trilogy has sold over a million copies.[391] Devon Ke Dev...Mahadev (2011–2014), a television serial about Shiva on the Life OK channel was among the most watched shows at its peak popularity.[395] Another popular film was the 2022 Gujarati language movie Har Har Mahadev.[393]\\n\\nSee also\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n^ This is the source for the version presented in Chidbhavananda, who refers to it being from the Mahabharata but does not explicitly clarify which of the two Mahabharata versions he is using.

            "Error:  `args[0]`: {'topic': 'Major deity in Hinduism\\n\\nVishnu ( ; Sanskrit: विष्णु, lit. \\'All Pervasive\\', IAST: Viṣṇu, pronounced [ʋɪʂɳʊ]), also known as Narayana and Hari, is one of the principal deities of Hinduism. He is the supreme being within Vaishnavism, one of the major traditions within contemporary Hinduism.[13][14]\\n\\nVishnu is known as The Preserver within the Trimurti, the triple deity of supreme divinity that includes Brahma and Shiva.[15][16] In Vaishnavism, Vishnu is the supreme Lord who creates, protects, and transforms the universe. Tridevi is stated to be the energy and creative power (Shakti) of each, with Lakshmi being the equal complementary partner of Vishnu.[17] He is one of the five equivalent deities in Panchayatana puja of the Smarta tradition of Hinduism.[16]\\n\\nAccording to Vaishnavism, the supreme being is with qualities (Saguna), and has definite form, but is limitless, transcendent and unchanging absolute Brahman, and the primal Atman (Self) of the universe.[18] There are both benevolent and fearsome depictions of Vishnu. In benevolent aspects, he is depicted as an omniscient being sleeping on the coils of the serpent Shesha (who represents time) floating in the primeval ocean of milk called Kshira Sagara with his consort, Lakshmi.[19]\\n\\nWhenever the world is threatened with evil, chaos, and destructive forces, Vishnu descends in the form of an avatar (incarnation) to restore the cosmic order and protect dharma. The Dashavatara are the ten primary avatars of Vishnu. Out of these ten, Rama and Krishna are the most important.[20]\\n\\nNomenclature\\n\\nVishnu (also spelled Viṣṇu, Sanskrit: विष्णु) means \\'all pervasive\\'[21] and, according to Medhātith ( c. 1000 CE), \\'one who is everything and inside everything\\'.[22] Vedanga scholar Yaska (4th century BCE) in the Nirukta defines Vishnu as viṣṇur viṣvater vā vyaśnoter vā (\\'one who enters everywhere\\'); also adding atha yad viṣito bhavati tad viṣnurbhavati (\\'that which is free from fetters and bondage is Vishnu\\').[23]\\n\\nIn the tenth part of the Padma Purana (4-15th century CE), Danta (Son of Bhīma and King of Vidarbha) lists 108 names of Vishnu (17.98–102).[24] These include the ten primary avatars (see Dashavarara, below) and descriptions of the qualities, attributes, or aspects of God.\\n\\nThe Garuda Purana (chapter XV)[25] and the \"Anushasana Parva\" of the Mahabharata both list over 1000 names for Vishnu, each name describing a quality, attribute, or aspect of God. Known as the Vishnu Sahasranama, Vishnu here is defined as \\'the omnipresent\\'.\\n\\nOther notable names in this list include :\\n\\nHari\\n\\nLakshmikanta\\n\\nJagannatha\\n\\nJanardana\\n\\nGovinda\\n\\nHrishikesha\\n\\nPadmanabha\\n\\nMukunda\\n\\nNarayana\\n\\nIconography\\n\\nMiniature painting of Vishnu and Lakshmi in the Salar Jung Museum , circa 1810\\n\\nVishnu iconography shows him with dark blue, blue-grey or black coloured skin, and as a well-dressed jewelled man. He is typically shown with four arms, but two-armed representations are also found in Hindu texts on artworks.[26][27]\\n\\nThe historic identifiers of his icon include his image holding a conch shell (shankha named Panchajanya) between the first two fingers of one hand (left back), a war discus (chakra named Sudarshana) in another (right back). The conch shell is spiral and symbolizes all of interconnected spiraling cyclic existence, while the discus symbolizes him as that which restores dharma with war if necessary when cosmic equilibrium is overwhelmed by evil.[26] One of his arms sometimes carries a club or mace (gada named Kaumodaki) which symbolizes authority and power of knowledge.[26] In the fourth arm, he holds a lotus flower (padma) which symbolizes purity and transcendence.[26][27][28] The items he holds in various hands vary, giving rise to twenty four combinations of iconography, each combination representing a special form of Vishnu. Each of these special forms is given a special name in texts such as the Agni Purana and the Padma Purana. These texts, however, are inconsistent.[29] Rarely, Vishnu is depicted bearing the bow Sharanga or the sword Nandaka. He is depicted with the Kaustubha gem in a necklace and wearing Vaijayanti, a garland of forest flowers. The shrivatsa mark is depicted on his chest in the form of a curl of hair. He generally wears yellow garments. He wears a crown called the Kiritamukuta.[30]\\n\\nVishnu iconography shows him either in standing pose, seated in a yoga pose, or reclining.[27] A traditional depiction of Vishnu is as Narayana, showing him reclining on the coils of the serpent Shesha floating over the divine ocean Kshira Sagara, accompanied by his consort Lakshmi, as he \"dreams the universe into reality.\"[31] His abode is described as Vaikuntha and his mount (vahana) is the bird king Garuda.[32]\\n\\nVishnu was associated with the sun because he used to be \"a minor solar deity but rose in importance in the following centuries.\"\\n\\nThe Trimurti\\n\\nShiva (left), Vishnu (middle), and Brahma (right).\\n\\nParticularly in Vaishnavism, the Trimurti (also known as the Hindu Triad or Great Trinity)[34][35] represents the three fundamental forces (guṇas) through which the universe is created, maintained, and destroyed in cyclic succession. Each of these forces is represented by a Hindu deity:[36][37]\\n\\nBrahma: presiding deity of Rajas (passion, creation)\\n\\npresiding deity of Rajas (passion, creation) Vishnu: presiding deity of Sattva (goodness, preservation)\\n\\npresiding deity of Sattva (goodness, preservation) Shiva: presiding deity of Tamas (darkness, destruction)\\n\\nThe trimurti themselves are beyond three gunas and are not affected by it.[38]\\n\\nIn Hindu tradition, the trio is often referred to as Brahma-Vishnu-Mahesh. All have the same meaning of three in one; different forms or manifestations of One person the Supreme Being.[39]\\n\\nAvatars\\n\\nThe concept of the avatar (or incarnation) within Hinduism is most often associated with Vishnu, the preserver or sustainer aspect of God within the Hindu Trimurti. The avatars of Vishnu descend to empower the good and to destroy evil, thereby restoring Dharma and relieving the burden of the Earth. An oft-quoted passage from the Bhagavad Gita describes the typical role of an avatar of Vishnu:\\n\\nWhenever righteousness wanes and unrighteousness increases I send myself forth.\\n\\nFor the protection of the good and for the destruction of evil,\\n\\nand for the establishment of righteousness,\\n\\nI come into being age after age. Bhagavad Gita 4.7–8\\n\\nVedic literature, in particular the Puranas (ancient; similar to encyclopedias) and Itihasa (chronicle, history, legend), narrate numerous avatars of Vishnu. The most well-known of these avatars are Krishna (most notably in the Vishnu Purana, Bhagavata Purana, and Mahabharata; the latter encompassing the Bhagavad Gita), and Rama (most notably in the Ramayana). Krishna in particular is venerated in Vaishnavism as the ultimate, primeval, transcendental source of all existence, including all the other demigods and gods, such as Vishnu.\\n\\nThe Mahabharata\\n\\nIn the Mahabharata, Vishnu (as Narayana) states to Narada that He will appear in the following ten incarnations:\\n\\nAppearing in the forms of a swan [Hamsa], a tortoise [Kurma], a fish [Matsya], O foremost of regenerate ones, I shall then display myself as a boar [Varaha], then as a Man-lion (Nrisingha), then as a dwarf [Vamana], then as Rama of Bhrigu\\'s race, then as Rama, the son of Dasaratha, then as Krishna the scion of the Sattwata race, and lastly as Kalki. Book 12, Santi Parva, Chapter CCCXL (340), translated by Kisari Mohan Ganguli, 1883–1896 [ 40 ]\\n\\nThe Puranas\\n\\nRavana converses with MAHAJAMBUNADA, who is surrounded by a ring of fire and attended by Laksmi\\n\\nSpecified avatars of Vishnu are listed against some of the Puranas in the table below. However, this is a complicated process, and the lists are unlikely to be exhaustive because:\\n\\nNot all Puranas provide lists per se (e.g. the Agni Purana dedicates entire chapters to avatars, and some of these chapters mention other avatars within them)\\n\\n(e.g. the Agni Purana dedicates entire chapters to avatars, and some of these chapters mention other avatars within them) A list may be given in one place but additional avatars may be mentioned elsewhere (e.g. the Bhagavata Purana lists 22 avatars in Canto 1, but mentions others elsewhere)\\n\\nManava Purana, the only Upa Purana lists 42 avatars of Vishnu.\\n\\nA personality in one Purana may be considered an avatar in another (e.g. Narada is not specified as an avatar in the Matsya Purana but is in the Bhagavata Purana)\\n\\nSome avatars consist of two or more people considered as different aspects of a single incarnation (e.g. Nara-Narayana, Rama and his three brothers)\\n\\nDashavatara\\n\\nThe Dashavatara is a list of the so-called Vibhavas, or \\'10 [primary] Avatars\\' of Vishnu. The Agni Purana, Varaha Purana, Padma Purana, Linga Purana, Narada Purana, Garuda Purana, and Skanda Purana all provide matching lists. The same Vibhavas are also found in the Garuda Purana Saroddhara, a commentary or \\'extracted essence\\' written by Navanidhirama about the Garuda Purana (i.e. not the Purana itself, with which it seems to be confused):\\n\\nApparent disagreements concerning the placement of either the Buddha or Balarama in the Dashavarara seems to occur from the Dashavarara list in the Shiva Purana (the only other list with ten avatars including Balarama in the Garuda Purana substitutes Vamana, not Buddha). Regardless, both versions of the Dashavarara have a scriptural basis in the canon of authentic Vedic literature (but not from the Garuda Purana Saroddhara).\\n\\nPerumal\\n\\nPerumal (Tamil: பெருமாள்)—also known as Thirumal (Tamil: திருமால்), or Mayon (as described in the Tamil scriptures)— was accepted as a manifestation of Vishnu during the process of the syncretism of South Indian deities into mainstream Hinduism. Mayon is indicated to be the deity associated with the mullai tiṇai (pastoral landscape) in the Tolkappiyam.[60][61] Tamil Sangam literature (200 BCE to 500 CE) mentions Mayon or the \"dark one\" and as the Supreme deity who creates, sustains, and destroys the universe and was worshipped in the plains and mountains of Tamilakam.[62] The verses of Paripadal describe the glory of Perumal in the most poetic of terms. Many Poems of the Paripadal consider Perumal as the Supreme god of Tamils.[62] He is a popular Hindu deity among Tamilians in Tamil Nadu, as well among the Tamil diaspora.[63][64] Revered by the Sri Vaishnava denomination of Hinduism, Perumal is venerated in popular tradition as Venkateshwara at Tirupati,[65] and Sri Ranganathaswamy at Srirangam.[66]\\n\\nLiterature\\n\\nVedas\\n\\nVishnu is a Rigvedic deity, but not a prominent one when compared to Indra, Agni and others.[67] Just 5 out of 1028 hymns of the Rigveda are dedicated to Vishnu, although he is mentioned in other hymns.[22] Vishnu is mentioned in the Brahmana layer of text in the Vedas, thereafter his profile rises and over the history of Indian scriptures, states Jan Gonda, Vishnu becomes a divinity of the highest rank, one equivalent to the Supreme Being.[67][68]\\n\\nThough a minor mention and with overlapping attributes in the Vedas, he has important characteristics in various hymns of the Rig Veda, such as 1.154.5, 1.56.3 and 10.15.3.[67] In these hymns, the Vedic scriptures assert that Vishnu resides in that highest home where departed Atman (Self) reside, an assertion that may have been the reason for his increasing emphasis and popularity in Hindu soteriology.[67][69] He is also described in the Vedic literature as the one who supports heaven and earth.[22]\\n\\nतदस्य प्रियमभि पाथो अश्यां नरो यत्र देवयवो मदन्ति । उरुक्रमस्य स हि बन्धुरित्था विष्णोः पदे परमे मध्व उत्सः ॥५॥ ऋग्वेद १-१५४-५ 5. Might I reach that dear cattle-pen of his, where men seeking the gods find elation, for exactly that is the bond to the wide-striding one: the wellspring of honey in the highest step of Viṣṇu. —RV. 1.154.5 [ 70 ] —translated by Stephanie Jamison, 2020 [ 71 ]\\n\\nआहं पितॄन्सुविदत्राँ अवित्सि नपातं च विक्रमणं च विष्णोः ।\\n\\nबर्हिषदो ये स्वधया सुतस्य भजन्त पित्वस्त इहागमिष्ठाः ॥३॥ ऋग्वेद १०-१५-३ 3. I have found here the forefathers good to find and the grandson and the wide stride of Viṣṇu.\\n\\nThose who, sitting on the ritual grass, share in the pressed soma and the food at (the cry of) \"svadhā\", they are the most welcome arrivals here. —RV 10.15.13 [ 70 ] —translated by Stephanie Jamison, 2020 [ 71 ]\\n\\nIn the Vedic hymns, Vishnu is invoked alongside other deities, especially Indra, whom he helps kill the symbol of evil named Vritra.[22][72] His distinguishing characteristic in the Vedas is his association with light. Two Rigvedic hymns in Mandala 7 refer to Vishnu. In section 7.99 of the Rigveda, Vishnu is addressed as the god who separates heaven and earth, a characteristic he shares with Indra. In the Vedic texts, the deity or god referred to as Vishnu is Surya or Savitr (Sun god), who also bears the name Suryanarayana. Again, this link to Surya is a characteristic Vishnu shares with fellow Vedic deities named Mitra and Agni, wherein in different hymns, they too \"bring men together\" and cause all living beings to rise up and impel them to go about their daily activities.[73]\\n\\nIn hymn 7.99 of Rigveda, Indra-Vishnu is equivalent and produce the sun, with the verses asserting that this sun is the source of all energy and light for all.[73] In other hymns of the Rigveda, Vishnu is a close friend of Indra.[74] Elsewhere in Rigveda, Atharvaveda and Upanishadic texts, Vishnu is equivalent to Prajapati, both are described as the protector and preparer of the womb, and according to Klaus Klostermaier, this may be the root behind the post-Vedic fusion of all the attributes of the Vedic Prajapati unto the avatars of Vishnu.[22]\\n\\nIn the Yajurveda, Taittiriya Aranyaka (10.13.1), \"Narayana sukta\", Narayana is mentioned as the supreme being. The first verse of \"Narayana Suktam\" mentions the words paramam padam, which literally mean \\'highest post\\' and may be understood as the \\'supreme abode for all Selfs\\'. This is also known as Param Dhama, Paramapadam, or Vaikuntha. Rigveda 1.22.20 also mentions the same paramam padam.[75]\\n\\nIn the Atharvaveda, the mythology of a boar who raises goddess earth from the depths of cosmic ocean appears, but without the word Vishnu or his alternate avatar names. In post-Vedic mythology, this legend becomes one of the basis of many cosmogonic myth called the Varaha legend, with Varaha as an avatar of Vishnu.[72]\\n\\nTrivikrama: The Three Steps of Vishnu\\n\\nSeveral hymns of the Rigveda repeat the mighty deed of Vishnu called the Trivikrama, which is one of the lasting mythologies in Hinduism since the Vedic times.[76] It is an inspiration for ancient artwork in numerous Hindu temples such as at the Ellora Caves, which depict the Trivikrama legend through the Vamana avatar of Vishnu.[77][78] Trivikrama refers to the celebrated three steps or \"three strides\" of Vishnu. Starting as a small insignificant looking being, Vishnu undertakes a herculean task of establishing his reach and form, then with his first step covers the earth, with second the ether, and the third entire heaven.[76][79]\\n\\nविष्णोर्नु कं वीर्याणि प्र वोचं यः पार्थिवानि विममे रजांसि ।\\n\\nयो अस्कभायदुत्तरं सधस्थं विचक्रमाणस्त्रेधोरुगायः ॥१॥…\\n\\n\\n\\nviṣṇōrnu kaṃ vīryāṇi pra vōcaṃ yaḥ pārthivāni vimamē rajāṃsi |\\n\\nyō askabhāyaduttaraṃ sadhasthaṃ vicakramāṇastrēdhōrugāyaḥ ||1||\\n\\n\\n\\nI will now proclaim the heroic deeds of Visnu, who has measured out the terrestrial regions,\\n\\nwho established the upper abode having, wide-paced, strode out triply… Rigveda 1.154.1, Translated by Jan Gonda [ 80 ]\\n\\nThe Vishnu Sukta 1.154 of Rigveda says that the first and second of Vishnu\\'s strides (those encompassing the earth and air) are visible to the mortals and the third is the realm of the immortals. The Trivikrama describing hymns integrate salvific themes, stating Vishnu to symbolize that which is freedom and life.[76] The Shatapatha Brahmana elaborates this theme of Vishnu, as his herculean effort and sacrifice to create and gain powers that help others, one who realizes and defeats the evil symbolized by the Asuras after they had usurped the three worlds, and thus Vishnu is the saviour of the mortals and the immortals (Devas).[76]\\n\\nBrahmanas\\n\\nTo what is One Seven germs unripened yet are heaven\\'s prolific seed:\\n\\ntheir functions they maintain by Vishnu\\'s ordinance.\\n\\nEndued with wisdom through intelligence and thought,\\n\\nthey compass us about present on every side.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat thing I truly am I know not clearly:\\n\\nmysterious, fettered in my mind I wonder.\\n\\nWhen the first-born of holy Law approached me,\\n\\nthen of this speech, I first obtain a portion.\\n\\n(...)\\n\\n\\n\\nThey call him Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Agni,\\n\\nand he is heavenly-winged Garutman.\\n\\nTo what is One, sages give many a title. — Rigveda 1.164.36–37, 46 [ 81 ] [ 82 ]\\n\\nThe Shatapatha Brahmana contains ideas which Vaishnavism tradition of Hinduism has long mapped to a pantheistic vision of Vishnu as supreme, he as the essence in every being and everything in the empirically perceived universe. In this Brahmana, states Klaus Klostermaier, Purusha Narayana (Vishnu) asserts, \"all the worlds have I placed within mine own self, and my own self has I placed within all the worlds.\"[83] The text equates Vishnu to all knowledge there is (Vedas), calling the essence of everything as imperishable, all Vedas and principles of universe as imperishable, and that this imperishable which is Vishnu is the all.[83]\\n\\nVishnu is described to be permeating all object and life forms, states S. Giora Shoham, where he is \"ever-present within all things as the intrinsic principle of all\", and the eternal, transcendental self in every being.[84] The Vedic literature, including its Brahmanas layer, while praising Vishnu do not subjugate others gods and goddesses. They present an inclusive pluralistic henotheism. According to Max Muller, \"Although the gods are sometimes distinctly invoked as the great and the small, the young and the old (Rig Veda 1:27:13), this is only an attempt to find the most comprehensive expression for the divine powers and nowhere is any of the gods represented as the subordinate to others. It would be easy to find, in the numerous hymns of the Veda, passages in which almost every single god is represented as supreme and absolute.\"[85]\\n\\nUpanishads\\n\\nThe Vaishnava Upanishads are minor Upanishads of Hinduism, related to Vishnu theology. There are 14 Vaishnava Upanishads in the Muktika anthology of 108 Upanishads. It is unclear when these texts were composed, and estimates vary from the 1st-century BCE to 17th-century CE for the texts.\\n\\nThese Upanishads highlight Vishnu, Narayana, Rama or one of his avatars as the supreme metaphysical reality called Brahman in Hinduism.[89][90] They discuss a diverse range of topics, from ethics to the methods of worship.\\n\\nPuranas\\n\\nThe Bhagavata Purana (c. 16th century) is centred around Krishna, a Vishnu avatar.\\n\\nVishnu is the primary focus of the Vaishnavism-focused Puranas genre of Hindu texts. Of these, according to Ludo Rocher, the most important texts are the Bhagavata Purana, Vishnu Purana, Nāradeya Purana, Garuda Purana and Vayu Purana. The Purana texts include many versions of cosmologies, mythologies, encyclopedic entries about various aspects of life, and chapters that were medieval era regional Vishnu temples-related tourist guides called mahatmyas.\\n\\nOne version of the cosmology, for example, states that Vishnu\\'s eye is at the Southern Celestial Pole from where he watches the cosmos.[94] In another version found in section 4.80 of the Vayu Purana, he is the Hiranyagarbha, or the golden egg from which were simultaneously born all feminine and masculine beings of the universe.[95]\\n\\nVishnu Purana\\n\\nThe Vishnu Purana presents Vishnu as the central element of its cosmology, unlike some other Puranas where Shiva or Brahma or goddess Shakti are. The reverence and the worship of Vishnu is described in 22 chapters of the first part of Vishnu Purana, along with the profuse use of the synonymous names of Vishnu such as Hari, Janardana, Madhava, Achyuta, Hrishikesha and others.\\n\\nThe Vishnu Purana also discusses the Hindu concept of supreme reality called Brahman in the context of the Upanishads; a discussion that the theistic Vedanta scholar Ramanuja interprets to be about the equivalence of the Brahman with Vishnu, a foundational theology in the Sri Vaishnavism tradition.[97]\\n\\nBhagavata Purana\\n\\nVishnu is equated with Brahman in the Bhagavata Purana, such as in verse 1.2.11, as \"learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this non-dual substance as Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan.\"[98]\\n\\nThe Bhagavata Purana has been the most popular and widely read Purana texts relating to Vishnu avatar Krishna, it has been translated and available in almost all Indian languages. Like other Puranas, it discusses a wide range of topics including cosmology, genealogy, geography, mythology, legend, music, dance, yoga and culture. As it begins, the forces of evil have won a war between the benevolent devas (deities) and evil asuras (demons) and now rule the universe. Truth re-emerges as the Vishnu avatar first makes peace with the demons, understands them and then creatively defeats them, bringing back hope, justice, freedom and good – a cyclic theme that appears in many legends.[102] The Bhagavata Purana is a revered text in Vaishnavism.[103] The Puranic legends of Vishnu have inspired plays and dramatic arts that are acted out over festivals, particularly through performance arts such as the Sattriya, Manipuri dance, Odissi, Kuchipudi, Kathakali, Kathak, Bharatanatyam, Bhagavata Mela and Mohiniyattam.[106]\\n\\nOther Puranas\\n\\nSome versions of the Purana texts, unlike the Vedic and Upanishadic texts, emphasize Vishnu as supreme and on whom other gods depend. Vishnu, for example, is the source of creator deity Brahma in the Vaishnavism-focussed Purana texts. Vishnu\\'s iconography and a Hindu myth typically shows Brahma being born in a lotus emerging from his navel, who then is described as creating the world or all the forms in the universe, but not the primordial universe itself. In contrast, the Shiva-focussed Puranas describe Brahma and Vishnu to have been created by Ardhanarishvara, that is half Shiva and half Parvati; or alternatively, Brahma was born from Rudra, or Vishnu, Shiva and Brahma creating each other cyclically in different aeons (kalpa).[109]\\n\\nIn some Vaishnava Puranas, Vishnu takes the form of Rudra or commands Rudra to destroy the world, thereafter the entire universe dissolves and along with time, everything is reabsorbed back into Vishnu. The universe is then recreated from Vishnu all over again, starting a new Kalpa.[110] For this the Bhagavata Purana employs the metaphor of Vishnu as a spider and the universe as his web. Other texts offer alternate cosmogenic theories, such as one where the universe and time are absorbed into Shiva.[110][111]\\n\\nAgama\\n\\nThe Agama scripture called the Pancharatra describes a mode of worship of Vishnu.\\n\\nSangam and Post-Sangam literature\\n\\nThe Sangam literature refers to an extensive regional collection in the Tamil language, mostly from the early centuries of the common era. These Tamil texts revere Vishnu and his avatars such as Krishna and Rama, as well as other pan-Indian deities such as Shiva, Muruga, Durga, Indra and others.[112] Vishnu is described in these texts as Mayon, or \"one who is dark or black in color\" (in north India, the equivalent word is Krishna).[112] Other terms found for Vishnu in these ancient Tamil genre of literature include mayavan, mamiyon, netiyon, mal and mayan.[113]\\n\\nKrishna as Vishnu avatar is the primary subject of two post-Sangam Tamil epics Silappadikaram and Manimekalai, each of which was probably composed about the 5th century CE.[114][115] These Tamil epics share many aspects of the story found in other parts of India, such as those related to baby Krishna such as stealing butter, and teenage Krishna such as teasing girls who went to bathe in a river by hiding their clothes.[114][116]\\n\\nBhakti movement\\n\\nIdeas about Vishnu in the mid 1st millennium CE were important to the Bhakti movement theology that ultimately swept India after the 12th century. The Alvars, which literally means \"those immersed in God\", were Tamil Vaishnava poet-saints who sang praises of Vishnu as they traveled from one place to another.[117] They established temple sites such as Srirangam, and spread ideas about Vaishnavism. Their poems, compiled as Alwar Arulicheyalgal or Divya Prabhandham, developed into an influential scripture for the Vaishnavas. The Bhagavata Purana\\'s references to the South Indian Alvar saints, along with its emphasis on bhakti, have led many scholars to give it South Indian origins, though some scholars question whether this evidence excludes the possibility that bhakti movement had parallel developments in other parts of India.[119]\\n\\nVaishnava theology\\n\\nThe Bhagavata Purana summarizes the Vaishnava theology, wherein it frequently discusses the merging of the individual Self with the Absolute Brahman (Ultimate Reality, Supreme Truth), or \"the return of Brahman into His own true nature\", a distinctly Advaitic or non-dualistic philosophy of Shankara.[120] The concept of moksha is explained as Ekatva (\\'Oneness\\') and Sayujya (\\'Absorption, intimate union\\'), wherein one is completely lost in Brahman (Self, Supreme Being, one\\'s true nature).[122] This, states Rukmini (1993), is proclamation of \"return of the individual Self to the Absolute and its merging into the Absolute\", which is unmistakably Advaitic in its trend.[122] In the same passages, the Bhagavata includes a mention of Bhagavan as the object of concentration, thereby presenting the Bhakti path from the three major paths of Hindu spirituality discussed in the Bhagavad Gita.[122][123]\\n\\nVaishnava thought holds Vishnu to exist in the alternate guise of \"Isvara, the Lord of All Being\" and the universe to be his breath that he will \"assimilate\" into him again, by breathing and causing the end of the world, which has happened before. Afterwards, he will \"exhale again and re-create the world.\"\\n\\nThe theology in the Bhagavad Gita discusses both the sentient and the non-sentient, the Self and the matter of existence. It envisions the universe as the body of Vishnu (Krishna), state Harold Coward and Daniel Maguire. Vishnu in Gita\\'s theology pervades all selves, all matter, and time,[124] and is associated with Brahman. In Sri Vaishnavism sub-tradition, Vishnu and Sri (goddess Lakshmi) are described as inseparable, that they pervade everything together. Both together are the creators, who also pervade and transcend their creation.[124]\\n\\nThe Bhagavata Purana, in many passages, parallels the ideas of Nirguna Brahman and non-duality of Adi Shankara. For example:\\n\\nThe aim of life is an inquiry into the Truth, and not the desire for enjoyment in heaven by performing religious rites,\\n\\nThose who possess the knowledge of the Truth, call the knowledge of non-duality as the Truth,\\n\\nIt is called Brahman, the Highest Self, and Bhagavan. Sūta, Bhagavata Purana 1.2.10–11, translated by Daniel Sheridan [ 125 ]\\n\\nScholars describe the Vaishnava theology as built on the foundation of non-dualism speculations in Upanishads, and term it as \"Advaitic Theism.\" The Bhagavata Purana suggests that Vishnu and the Self (Atman) in all beings is one.[120] Bryant states that the monism discussed in Bhagavata Purana is certainly built on the Vedanta foundations, but not exactly the same as the monism of Adi Shankara.[127] The Bhagavata asserts, according to Bryant, that the empirical and the spiritual universe are both metaphysical realities, and manifestations of the same Oneness, just like heat and light are \"real but different\" manifestations of sunlight.[127]\\n\\nIn the Bhakti tradition of Vaishnavism, Vishnu is attributed with numerous qualities such as omniscience, energy, strength, lordship, vigour, and splendour.[128] The Vaishnava tradition started by Madhvacharya considers Vishnu in the form of Krishna to be the supreme creator, personal God, all-pervading, all devouring, one whose knowledge and grace leads to \"moksha\".[129] In Madhvacharya Vaishnava theology, the supreme Vishnu and the Selfs of living beings are two different realities and nature (dualism), while in Ramanuja\\'s Sri Vaishnavism, they are different but share the same essential nature (qualified non-dualism).[130][131][132]\\n\\nAssociated deities\\n\\nLakshmi\\n\\nVishnu with Lakshmi (Lakshmi Narayan) on Garuda, painted in gouache c. 1820\\n\\nLakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth, fortune and prosperity (both material and spiritual), is the wife and active energy of Vishnu.[133][134] She is also called Sri.[135][136] When Vishnu incarnated on earth as the avatars Rama and Krishna, Lakshmi incarnated as his respective consorts: Sita and Radha or Rukmini.[137][138]\\n\\nVarious regional beliefs consider Lakshmi to be manifested as various goddesses, who are considered Vishnu\\'s wives. In South India, Lakshmi is worshipped in two forms – Sridevi and Bhudevi.[139] In Tirupati, Venkateshwara (identified as a form of Vishnu) is depicted with consorts, Lakshmi and Padmavathi.[140]\\n\\nGaruda\\n\\nAmong Vishnu\\'s primary mounts (vahana) is Garuda, the demigod eagle. Vishnu is commonly depicted as riding on his shoulders. Garuda is also considered as Vedas on which Vishnu travels. Garuda is a sacred bird in Vaishnavism. In the Garuda Purana, Garuda carries Vishnu to save the elephant Gajendra.[141][142]\\n\\nShesha\\n\\nVishnu sleeps on the coils of Ananta (Shesha, the World Snake). He will awake for the next cycle of creation which heralds the destruction of all things. 14th century sculpture from India, housed in National Museum of Scotland\\n\\nOne of the primordial beings of creation, Shesha, or Adishesha, is the king of the serpents in Hindu mythology.[143] Residing in Vaikuntha, Vishnu sleeps upon Adishesha in a perpetual slumber in his form of Narayana.[144]\\n\\nVishvaksena\\n\\nVishvaksena, also known as Senadhipathi (both meaning \\'army-chief\\'), is the commander-in-chief of the army of Vishnu.\\n\\nHarihara\\n\\nHarihara – Combined form of Vishnu and Shiva, c. 1825\\n\\nShiva and Vishnu are both viewed as the ultimate form of god in different Hindu denominations. Harihara is a composite of half Vishnu and half Shiva, mentioned in literature such as the Vamana Purana (chapter 36),[145] and in artwork found from mid 1st millennium CE, such as in the cave 1 and cave 3 of the 6th-century Badami cave temples.[146][147] Another half Vishnu half Shiva form, which is also called Harirudra, is mentioned in Mahabharata.[148]\\n\\nBeyond Hinduism\\n\\nSikhism\\n\\nVishnu is referred to as Gorakh in the scriptures of Sikhism.[149] For example, in verse 5 of Japji Sahib, the Guru (\\'teacher\\') is praised as who gives the word and shows the wisdom, and through whom the awareness of immanence is gained. Guru Nanak, according to Shackle and Mandair (2013), teaches that the Guru are \"Shiva (isar), Vishnu (gorakh), Brahma (barma) and mother Parvati (parbati),\" yet the one who is all and true cannot be described.[150]\\n\\nThe Chaubis Avtar lists the 24 avatars of Vishnu, including Krishna, Rama, and Buddha. Similarly, the Dasam Granth includes Vishnu mythology that mirrors that found in the Vaishnav tradition.[151] The latter is of particular importance to Sanatan Sikhs, including Udasis, Nirmalas, Nanakpanthis, Sahajdhari, and Keshdhari/Khalsa sects of Sikhism; however, the Khalsa Sikhs disagree with the Sanatan Sikhs.[151][152] According to Sanatan Sikh writers, the Gurus of Sikhism were avatars of Vishnu, because the Gurus brought light in the age of darkness and saved people in a time of evil Mughal-era persecution.[153][154][155]\\n\\nBuddhism\\n\\nTheravada Buddhism\\n\\nVishnu bearing a tray of flowers. A painting of the relic chamber of Mahiyangana Stupa (9-11 centuries CE). Currently displayed at Archaeological Museum of Anuradhapura.\\n\\nA modern Buddhist Vishnu shrine in Dondra, Sri Lanka.\\n\\nWhile some Hindus consider Buddha as an incarnation of Vishnu, Buddhists in Sri Lanka venerate Vishnu as the custodian deity of Sri Lanka and protector of Buddhism.[156]\\n\\nVishnu is also known as Upulvan or Upalavarṇā, meaning \\'Blue Lotus coloured\\'. Some postulate that Uthpala varna was a local deity who later merged with Vishnu while another belief is that Utpalavarṇā was an early form of Vishnu before he became a supreme deity in Puranic Hinduism. According to the chronicles of Mahāvaṃsa, Cūḷavaṃsa, and folklore in Sri Lanka, Buddha himself handed over the custodianship to Vishnu. Others believe that Buddha entrusted this task to Sakra (Indra), who delegated this task of custodianship to Vishnu.[157] Many Buddhist and Hindu shrines are dedicated to Vishnu in Sri Lanka. In addition to specific Vishnu Kovils or Devalayas, all Buddhist temples necessarily house shrine rooms (Devalayas) closer to the main Buddhist shrine dedicated to Vishnu.[158]\\n\\nJohn Holt states that Vishnu was one of the several Hindu gods and goddesses who were integrated into the Sinhala Buddhist religious culture, such as the 14th and 15th-century Lankatilaka and Gadaladeniya Buddhist temples.[159] He states that the medieval Sinhala tradition encouraged Visnu worship (puja) as a part of Theravada Buddhism just like Hindu tradition incorporated the Buddha as an avatar of Vishnu, but contemporary Theravada monks are attempting to purge the Vishnu worship practice from Buddhist temples.[160] According to Holt, the veneration of Vishnu in Sri Lanka is evidence of a remarkable ability over many centuries, to reiterate and reinvent culture as other ethnicities have been absorbed into their own. Though the Vishnu cult in Ceylon was formally endorsed by Kandyan kings in the early 1700s, Holt states that Vishnu images and shrines are among conspicuous ruins in the medieval capital Polonnaruwa.\\n\\nVishnu iconography such as statues and etchings have been found in archaeological sites of Southeast Asia, now predominantly of the Theravada Buddhist tradition. In Thailand, for example, statues of four-armed Vishnu have been found in provinces near Malaysia and dated to be from the 4th to 9th-century, and this mirror those found in ancient India.[161] Similarly, Vishnu statues have been discovered from the 6th to 8th century eastern Prachinburi Province and central Phetchabun Province of Thailand and southern Đồng Tháp Province and An Giang Province of Vietnam. Krishna statues dated to the early 7th century to 9th century have been discovered in Takéo Province and other provinces of Cambodia.\\n\\nMahayana Buddhism\\n\\nNīlakaṇṭha-Avalokiteśvara (青頸観音 Shōkyō-kannon), from the Besson-zakki (別尊雑記 \"Miscellaneous Record of Classified Sacred Images\"), as reproduced in the Taishō Shinshū Daizōkyō Zuzō-bu (大正新脩大藏經 圖像部), vol. 3.\\n\\nNārāyaṇa (那羅延天 Naraen-ten), the Chinese Buddhist version of Hindu God Vishnu, from volume 9 of the Shoson Zuzōshō (諸尊図像鈔), a compendium of Buddhist images.\\n\\nIn Mahayana Buddhism sources, Vishnu (along with other deities) was adopted into the vast pantheon of Buddhist deities. These deities are often associated with the multiform Avalokiteśvara. Mahayana Buddhism holds that Avalokiteśvara is able to manifest in different forms according to the needs of different beings (a doctrine called \"skillful means\" - upaya). The Lotus Sūtra states that Avalokiteśvara can take many different forms, including Īśvara and Maheśvara - to teach the Dharma to various classes of beings.[164]\\n\\nAnother Mahayana sutra, the Kāraṇḍavyūhasūtra, names Vishnu (along with Shiva, Brahma and Saraswati), as emanations of Avalokiteśvara, now seen as a transcendent deity out of which the entire world emanates.[165] The Karandavyuha states that Narayana was emanated from Avalokiteshvara\\'s heart (hṛdayānnārāyaṇaḥ), as a skillful means (upaya) for the benefit of all beings. In a similar manner, Harihara is called a bodhisattva in the popular Nīlakaṇṭha Dhāraṇī, which states: \"O Effulgence, World-Transcendent, come, oh Hari, the great bodhisattva.\"[166]\\n\\nFurthermore, the Ratnamalastotra states:\\n\\nIn order to teach the Vaishnavas and convert then to the Dharma, he (Vishnu) emanated from the heart of the lotus holder (Avalokitesvara). He is truly Narayana indeed, the lord of the world. Thus, you are indeed the greatest being (puṁsāṁ paramottama), without equal.[167]\\n\\nThese Indian Buddhist sources depict a stage of the development of Indian Mahayana in which Vishnu (along with Shiva) was being assimilated into a supreme universal form of Avalokiteśvara which is similar to the Hindu concept of Viśvarūpa.[168]\\n\\nLater Vajrayana sources continue to refer to Vishnu as a form of Avalokiteśvara. For example, the Sadhanamala contains a spiritual practice in which one meditates on a form of Vishnu called Harihariharivāhana or Harihariharivāhanalokeśvara.[169] This form includes Avalokiteśvara riding on Vishnu who in turn rides on Garuda, who also rides a lion.[170] This form of Lokeśvara might be Nepalese in origin and its source myth might be found in the Buddhist Swayambhu Purana.[171]\\n\\nArcheological studies have uncovered Vishnu statues on the islands of Indonesia, which was once a great stronghold of Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism. These statues have been dated to the 5th century and thereafter. In addition to statues, inscriptions and carvings of Vishnu, such as those related to the \"three steps of Vishnu\" (Trivikrama) have been found in many parts of Buddhist southeast Asia. In some iconography, the symbolism of Surya, Vishnu and Buddha are fused.\\n\\nIn Japanese Buddhist pantheon, Vishnu is known as Bichū-ten (毘紐天), and he appears in Japanese texts such as the 13th century compositions of Nichiren.[175]\\n\\nIn science\\n\\n4034 Vishnu is an asteroid discovered by Eleanor F.

Wisnu is the god of justice or welfare, Wisnu was the fifth son of Batara Guru and Batari Uma. He is the most powerful son of all the sons of Batara Guru.\\n\\nWisnu is described as a god who has bluish black or dark blue skin, has four arms, each of which holds a weapon, namely a mace, a lotus, a trumpet and a Cakra. He can also do tiwikrama, become an infinitely large giant.\\n\\nAccording to Javanese mythology, Wisnu first came down to the world and became a king with the title Srimaharaja Suman. The country is called Medangpura, located in the present-day Central Java region. Then changed its name to Sri Maharaja Matsyapati. In addition, according to the Javanese wayang puppet version, Batara Wisnu also incarnates Srimaharaja Kanwa, Resi Wisnungkara, Prabu Arjunasasrabahu, Sri Ramawijaya, Sri Batara Kresna, Prabu Airlangga, Prabu Jayabaya, Prabu Anglingdarma.\\n\\nIn Javanese mythology, Wisnu also incarnated as a matsya (fish) to kill the giant Hargragiwa who stole the Veda. Become Narasingha (human with a tiger head) to destroy King Hiranyakashipu. He once intended to become a Wimana (dwarf) to defeat Ditya Bali. Batara Wisnu also incarnated in Ramaparasu to destroy gandarwa. Incarnated as Arjunasasra or Arjunawijaya to defeat King Rahwana. The last one was for King Krishna to become the great Pandavas parampara or advisor to get rid of greed and evil committed by the Kauravas.\\n\\nSang Hyang Wisnu has a mount in the form of a giant garuda named Bhirawan. Because of his affection for the garuda he rode, Bhirawan was then adopted as son-in-law, married to one of his daughters named Dewi Kastapi.[178]\\n\\nTemples\\n\\nThe front-view of Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala\\n\\nSome of the earliest surviving grand Vishnu temples in India have been dated to the Gupta Empire period. The Sarvatobhadra temple in Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, for example, is dated to the early 6th century and features the ten avatars of Vishnu.[180] Its design based on a square layout and Vishnu iconography broadly follows the 1st millennium Hindu texts on architecture and construction such as the Brihat Samhita and Visnudharmottarapurana.[182]\\n\\nArchaeological evidence suggest that Vishnu temples and iconography probably were already in existence by the 1st century BCE. The most significant Vishnu-related epigraphy and archaeological remains are the two 1st century BCE inscriptions in Rajasthan which refer to temples of Sankarshana and Vasudeva, the Besnagar Garuda column of 100 BCE which mentions a Bhagavata temple, another inscription in Naneghat cave in Maharashtra by a Queen Naganika that also mentions Sankarshana, Vasudeva along with other major Hindu deities and several discoveries in Mathura relating to Vishnu, all dated to about the start of the common era.[184][185]\\n\\nThe Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, is dedicated to Vishnu.

The temple occupies an area of 156 acres (630,000 m) with a perimeter of 4,116 m (13,504 ft) making it the largest temple in India and one of the largest religious complexes in the world.\\n\\nGallery\\n\\nReferences', 'text': 'Compose a mythological tale about Major deity in Hinduism\\n\\nVishnu ( ; Sanskrit: विष्णु, lit. \\'All Pervasive\\', IAST: Viṣṇu, pronounced [ʋɪʂɳʊ]), also known as Narayana and Hari, is one of the principal deities of Hinduism. He is the supreme being within Vaishnavism, one of the major traditions within contemporary Hinduism.[13][14]\\n\\nVishnu is known as The Preserver within the Trimurti, the triple deity of supreme divinity that includes Brahma and Shiva.[15][16] In Vaishnavism, Vishnu is the supreme Lord who creates, protects, and transforms the universe. Tridevi is stated to be the energy and creative power (Shakti) of each, with Lakshmi being the equal complementary partner of Vishnu.[17] He is one of the five equivalent deities in Panchayatana puja of the Smarta tradition of Hinduism.[16]\\n\\nAccording to Vaishnavism, the supreme being is with qualities (Saguna), and has definite form, but is limitless, transcendent and unchanging absolute Brahman, and the primal Atman (Self) of the universe.[18] There are both benevolent and fearsome depictions of Vishnu. In benevolent aspects, he is depicted as an omniscient being sleeping on the coils of the serpent Shesha (who represents time) floating in the primeval ocean of milk called Kshira Sagara with his consort, Lakshmi.[19]\\n\\nWhenever the world is threatened with evil, chaos, and destructive forces, Vishnu descends in the form of an avatar (incarnation) to restore the cosmic order and protect dharma. The Dashavatara are the ten primary avatars of Vishnu. Out of these ten, Rama and Krishna are the most important.[20]\\n\\nNomenclature\\n\\nVishnu (also spelled Viṣṇu, Sanskrit: विष्णु) means \\'all pervasive\\'[21] and, according to Medhātith ( c. 1000 CE), \\'one who is everything and inside everything\\'.[22] Vedanga scholar Yaska (4th century BCE) in the Nirukta defines Vishnu as viṣṇur viṣvater vā vyaśnoter vā (\\'one who enters everywhere\\'); also adding atha yad viṣito bhavati tad viṣnurbhavati (\\'that which is free from fetters and bondage is Vishnu\\').[23]\\n\\nIn the tenth part of the Padma Purana (4-15th century CE), Danta (Son of Bhīma and King of Vidarbha) lists 108 names of Vishnu (17.98–102).[24] These include the ten primary avatars (see Dashavarara, below) and descriptions of the qualities, attributes, or aspects of God.\\n\\nThe Garuda Purana (chapter XV)[25] and the \"Anushasana Parva\" of the Mahabharata both list over 1000 names for Vishnu, each name describing a quality, attribute, or aspect of God. Known as the Vishnu Sahasranama, Vishnu here is defined as \\'the omnipresent\\'.\\n\\nOther notable names in this list include :\\n\\nHari\\n\\nLakshmikanta\\n\\nJagannatha\\n\\nJanardana\\n\\nGovinda\\n\\nHrishikesha\\n\\nPadmanabha\\n\\nMukunda\\n\\nNarayana\\n\\nIconography\\n\\nMiniature painting of Vishnu and Lakshmi in the Salar Jung Museum , circa 1810\\n\\nVishnu iconography shows him with dark blue, blue-grey or black coloured skin, and as a well-dressed jewelled man. He is typically shown with four arms, but two-armed representations are also found in Hindu texts on artworks.[26][27]\\n\\nThe historic identifiers of his icon include his image holding a conch shell (shankha named Panchajanya) between the first two fingers of one hand (left back), a war discus (chakra named Sudarshana) in another (right back). The conch shell is spiral and symbolizes all of interconnected spiraling cyclic existence, while the discus symbolizes him as that which restores dharma with war if necessary when cosmic equilibrium is overwhelmed by evil.[26] One of his arms sometimes carries a club or mace (gada named Kaumodaki) which symbolizes authority and power of knowledge.[26] In the fourth arm, he holds a lotus flower (padma) which symbolizes purity and transcendence.[26][27][28] The items he holds in various hands vary, giving rise to twenty four combinations of iconography, each combination representing a special form of Vishnu. Each of these special forms is given a special name in texts such as the Agni Purana and the Padma Purana. These texts, however, are inconsistent.[29] Rarely, Vishnu is depicted bearing the bow Sharanga or the sword Nandaka. He is depicted with the Kaustubha gem in a necklace and wearing Vaijayanti, a garland of forest flowers. The shrivatsa mark is depicted on his chest in the form of a curl of hair. He generally wears yellow garments. He wears a crown called the Kiritamukuta.[30]\\n\\nVishnu iconography shows him either in standing pose, seated in a yoga pose, or reclining.[27] A traditional depiction of Vishnu is as Narayana, showing him reclining on the coils of the serpent Shesha floating over the divine ocean Kshira Sagara, accompanied by his consort Lakshmi, as he \"dreams the universe into reality.\"[31] His abode is described as Vaikuntha and his mount (vahana) is the bird king Garuda.[32]\\n\\nVishnu was associated with the sun because he used to be \"a minor solar deity but rose in importance in the following centuries.\"\\n\\nThe Trimurti\\n\\nShiva (left), Vishnu (middle), and Brahma (right).\\n\\nParticularly in Vaishnavism, the Trimurti (also known as the Hindu Triad or Great Trinity)[34][35] represents the three fundamental forces (guṇas) through which the universe is created, maintained, and destroyed in cyclic succession. Each of these forces is represented by a Hindu deity:[36][37]\\n\\nBrahma: presiding deity of Rajas (passion, creation)\\n\\npresiding deity of Rajas (passion, creation) Vishnu: presiding deity of Sattva (goodness, preservation)\\n\\npresiding deity of Sattva (goodness, preservation) Shiva: presiding deity of Tamas (darkness, destruction)\\n\\nThe trimurti themselves are beyond three gunas and are not affected by it.[38]\\n\\nIn Hindu tradition, the trio is often referred to as Brahma-Vishnu-Mahesh. All have the same meaning of three in one; different forms or manifestations of One person the Supreme Being.[39]\\n\\nAvatars\\n\\nThe concept of the avatar (or incarnation) within Hinduism is most often associated with Vishnu, the preserver or sustainer aspect of God within the Hindu Trimurti. The avatars of Vishnu descend to empower the good and to destroy evil, thereby restoring Dharma and relieving the burden of the Earth. An oft-quoted passage from the Bhagavad Gita describes the typical role of an avatar of Vishnu:\\n\\nWhenever righteousness wanes and unrighteousness increases I send myself forth.\\n\\nFor the protection of the good and for the destruction of evil,\\n\\nand for the establishment of righteousness,\\n\\nI come into being age after age. Bhagavad Gita 4.7–8\\n\\nVedic literature, in particular the Puranas (ancient; similar to encyclopedias) and Itihasa (chronicle, history, legend), narrate numerous avatars of Vishnu. The most well-known of these avatars are Krishna (most notably in the Vishnu Purana, Bhagavata Purana, and Mahabharata; the latter encompassing the Bhagavad Gita), and Rama (most notably in the Ramayana). Krishna in particular is venerated in Vaishnavism as the ultimate, primeval, transcendental source of all existence, including all the other demigods and gods, such as Vishnu.\\n\\nThe Mahabharata\\n\\nIn the Mahabharata, Vishnu (as Narayana) states to Narada that He will appear in the following ten incarnations:\\n\\nAppearing in the forms of a swan [Hamsa], a tortoise [Kurma], a fish [Matsya], O foremost of regenerate ones, I shall then display myself as a boar [Varaha], then as a Man-lion (Nrisingha), then as a dwarf [Vamana], then as Rama of Bhrigu\\'s race, then as Rama, the son of Dasaratha, then as Krishna the scion of the Sattwata race, and lastly as Kalki. Book 12, Santi Parva, Chapter CCCXL (340), translated by Kisari Mohan Ganguli, 1883–1896 [ 40 ]\\n\\nThe Puranas\\n\\nRavana converses with MAHAJAMBUNADA, who is surrounded by a ring of fire and attended by Laksmi\\n\\nSpecified avatars of Vishnu are listed against some of the Puranas in the table below. However, this is a complicated process, and the lists are unlikely to be exhaustive because:\\n\\nNot all Puranas provide lists per se (e.g. the Agni Purana dedicates entire chapters to avatars, and some of these chapters mention other avatars within them)\\n\\n(e.g. the Agni Purana dedicates entire chapters to avatars, and some of these chapters mention other avatars within them) A list may be given in one place but additional avatars may be mentioned elsewhere (e.g. the Bhagavata Purana lists 22 avatars in Canto 1, but mentions others elsewhere)\\n\\nManava Purana, the only Upa Purana lists 42 avatars of Vishnu.\\n\\nA personality in one Purana may be considered an avatar in another (e.g. Narada is not specified as an avatar in the Matsya Purana but is in the Bhagavata Purana)\\n\\nSome avatars consist of two or more people considered as different aspects of a single incarnation (e.g. Nara-Narayana, Rama and his three brothers)\\n\\nDashavatara\\n\\nThe Dashavatara is a list of the so-called Vibhavas, or \\'10 [primary] Avatars\\' of Vishnu. The Agni Purana, Varaha Purana, Padma Purana, Linga Purana, Narada Purana, Garuda Purana, and Skanda Purana all provide matching lists. The same Vibhavas are also found in the Garuda Purana Saroddhara, a commentary or \\'extracted essence\\' written by Navanidhirama about the Garuda Purana (i.e. not the Purana itself, with which it seems to be confused):\\n\\nApparent disagreements concerning the placement of either the Buddha or Balarama in the Dashavarara seems to occur from the Dashavarara list in the Shiva Purana (the only other list with ten avatars including Balarama in the Garuda Purana substitutes Vamana, not Buddha). Regardless, both versions of the Dashavarara have a scriptural basis in the canon of authentic Vedic literature (but not from the Garuda Purana Saroddhara).\\n\\nPerumal\\n\\nPerumal (Tamil: பெருமாள்)—also known as Thirumal (Tamil: திருமால்), or Mayon (as described in the Tamil scriptures)— was accepted as a manifestation of Vishnu during the process of the syncretism of South Indian deities into mainstream Hinduism. Mayon is indicated to be the deity associated with the mullai tiṇai (pastoral landscape) in the Tolkappiyam.[60][61] Tamil Sangam literature (200 BCE to 500 CE) mentions Mayon or the \"dark one\" and as the Supreme deity who creates, sustains, and destroys the universe and was worshipped in the plains and mountains of Tamilakam.[62] The verses of Paripadal describe the glory of Perumal in the most poetic of terms. Many Poems of the Paripadal consider Perumal as the Supreme god of Tamils.[62] He is a popular Hindu deity among Tamilians in Tamil Nadu, as well among the Tamil diaspora.[63][64] Revered by the Sri Vaishnava denomination of Hinduism, Perumal is venerated in popular tradition as Venkateshwara at Tirupati,[65] and Sri Ranganathaswamy at Srirangam.[66]\\n\\nLiterature\\n\\nVedas\\n\\nVishnu is a Rigvedic deity, but not a prominent one when compared to Indra, Agni and others.[67] Just 5 out of 1028 hymns of the Rigveda are dedicated to Vishnu, although he is mentioned in other hymns.[22] Vishnu is mentioned in the Brahmana layer of text in the Vedas, thereafter his profile rises and over the history of Indian scriptures, states Jan Gonda, Vishnu becomes a divinity of the highest rank, one equivalent to the Supreme Being.[67][68]\\n\\nThough a minor mention and with overlapping attributes in the Vedas, he has important characteristics in various hymns of the Rig Veda, such as 1.154.5, 1.56.3 and 10.15.3.[67] In these hymns, the Vedic scriptures assert that Vishnu resides in that highest home where departed Atman (Self) reside, an assertion that may have been the reason for his increasing emphasis and popularity in Hindu soteriology.[67][69] He is also described in the Vedic literature as the one who supports heaven and earth.[22]\\n\\nतदस्य प्रियमभि पाथो अश्यां नरो यत्र देवयवो मदन्ति । उरुक्रमस्य स हि बन्धुरित्था विष्णोः पदे परमे मध्व उत्सः ॥५॥ ऋग्वेद १-१५४-५ 5. Might I reach that dear cattle-pen of his, where men seeking the gods find elation, for exactly that is the bond to the wide-striding one: the wellspring of honey in the highest step of Viṣṇu. —RV. 1.154.5 [ 70 ] —translated by Stephanie Jamison, 2020 [ 71 ]\\n\\nआहं पितॄन्सुविदत्राँ अवित्सि नपातं च विक्रमणं च विष्णोः ।\\n\\nबर्हिषदो ये स्वधया सुतस्य भजन्त पित्वस्त इहागमिष्ठाः ॥३॥ ऋग्वेद १०-१५-३ 3. I have found here the forefathers good to find and the grandson and the wide stride of Viṣṇu.\\n\\nThose who, sitting on the ritual grass, share in the pressed soma and the food at (the cry of) \"svadhā\", they are the most welcome arrivals here. —RV 10.15.13 [ 70 ] —translated by Stephanie Jamison, 2020 [ 71 ]\\n\\nIn the Vedic hymns, Vishnu is invoked alongside other deities, especially Indra, whom he helps kill the symbol of evil named Vritra.[22][72] His distinguishing characteristic in the Vedas is his association with light. Two Rigvedic hymns in Mandala 7 refer to Vishnu. In section 7.99 of the Rigveda, Vishnu is addressed as the god who separates heaven and earth, a characteristic he shares with Indra. In the Vedic texts, the deity or god referred to as Vishnu is Surya or Savitr (Sun god), who also bears the name Suryanarayana. Again, this link to Surya is a characteristic Vishnu shares with fellow Vedic deities named Mitra and Agni, wherein in different hymns, they too \"bring men together\" and cause all living beings to rise up and impel them to go about their daily activities.[73]\\n\\nIn hymn 7.99 of Rigveda, Indra-Vishnu is equivalent and produce the sun, with the verses asserting that this sun is the source of all energy and light for all.[73] In other hymns of the Rigveda, Vishnu is a close friend of Indra.[74] Elsewhere in Rigveda, Atharvaveda and Upanishadic texts, Vishnu is equivalent to Prajapati, both are described as the protector and preparer of the womb, and according to Klaus Klostermaier, this may be the root behind the post-Vedic fusion of all the attributes of the Vedic Prajapati unto the avatars of Vishnu.[22]\\n\\nIn the Yajurveda, Taittiriya Aranyaka (10.13.1), \"Narayana sukta\", Narayana is mentioned as the supreme being. The first verse of \"Narayana Suktam\" mentions the words paramam padam, which literally mean \\'highest post\\' and may be understood as the \\'supreme abode for all Selfs\\'. This is also known as Param Dhama, Paramapadam, or Vaikuntha. Rigveda 1.22.20 also mentions the same paramam padam.[75]\\n\\nIn the Atharvaveda, the mythology of a boar who raises goddess earth from the depths of cosmic ocean appears, but without the word Vishnu or his alternate avatar names. In post-Vedic mythology, this legend becomes one of the basis of many cosmogonic myth called the Varaha legend, with Varaha as an avatar of Vishnu.[72]\\n\\nTrivikrama: The Three Steps of Vishnu\\n\\nSeveral hymns of the Rigveda repeat the mighty deed of Vishnu called the Trivikrama, which is one of the lasting mythologies in Hinduism since the Vedic times.[76] It is an inspiration for ancient artwork in numerous Hindu temples such as at the Ellora Caves, which depict the Trivikrama legend through the Vamana avatar of Vishnu.[77][78] Trivikrama refers to the celebrated three steps or \"three strides\" of Vishnu. Starting as a small insignificant looking being, Vishnu undertakes a herculean task of establishing his reach and form, then with his first step covers the earth, with second the ether, and the third entire heaven.[76][79]\\n\\nविष्णोर्नु कं वीर्याणि प्र वोचं यः पार्थिवानि विममे रजांसि ।\\n\\nयो अस्कभायदुत्तरं सधस्थं विचक्रमाणस्त्रेधोरुगायः ॥१॥…\\n\\n\\n\\nviṣṇōrnu kaṃ vīryāṇi pra vōcaṃ yaḥ pārthivāni vimamē rajāṃsi |\\n\\nyō askabhāyaduttaraṃ sadhasthaṃ vicakramāṇastrēdhōrugāyaḥ ||1||\\n\\n\\n\\nI will now proclaim the heroic deeds of Visnu, who has measured out the terrestrial regions,\\n\\nwho established the upper abode having, wide-paced, strode out triply… Rigveda 1.154.1, Translated by Jan Gonda [ 80 ]\\n\\nThe Vishnu Sukta 1.154 of Rigveda says that the first and second of Vishnu\\'s strides (those encompassing the earth and air) are visible to the mortals and the third is the realm of the immortals. The Trivikrama describing hymns integrate salvific themes, stating Vishnu to symbolize that which is freedom and life.[76] The Shatapatha Brahmana elaborates this theme of Vishnu, as his herculean effort and sacrifice to create and gain powers that help others, one who realizes and defeats the evil symbolized by the Asuras after they had usurped the three worlds, and thus Vishnu is the saviour of the mortals and the immortals (Devas).[76]\\n\\nBrahmanas\\n\\nTo what is One Seven germs unripened yet are heaven\\'s prolific seed:\\n\\ntheir functions they maintain by Vishnu\\'s ordinance.\\n\\nEndued with wisdom through intelligence and thought,\\n\\nthey compass us about present on every side.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat thing I truly am I know not clearly:\\n\\nmysterious, fettered in my mind I wonder.\\n\\nWhen the first-born of holy Law approached me,\\n\\nthen of this speech, I first obtain a portion.\\n\\n(...)\\n\\n\\n\\nThey call him Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Agni,\\n\\nand he is heavenly-winged Garutman.\\n\\nTo what is One, sages give many a title. — Rigveda 1.164.36–37, 46 [ 81 ] [ 82 ]\\n\\nThe Shatapatha Brahmana contains ideas which Vaishnavism tradition of Hinduism has long mapped to a pantheistic vision of Vishnu as supreme, he as the essence in every being and everything in the empirically perceived universe. In this Brahmana, states Klaus Klostermaier, Purusha Narayana (Vishnu) asserts, \"all the worlds have I placed within mine own self, and my own self has I placed within all the worlds.\"[83] The text equates Vishnu to all knowledge there is (Vedas), calling the essence of everything as imperishable, all Vedas and principles of universe as imperishable, and that this imperishable which is Vishnu is the all.[83]\\n\\nVishnu is described to be permeating all object and life forms, states S. Giora Shoham, where he is \"ever-present within all things as the intrinsic principle of all\", and the eternal, transcendental self in every being.[84] The Vedic literature, including its Brahmanas layer, while praising Vishnu do not subjugate others gods and goddesses. They present an inclusive pluralistic henotheism. According to Max Muller, \"Although the gods are sometimes distinctly invoked as the great and the small, the young and the old (Rig Veda 1:27:13), this is only an attempt to find the most comprehensive expression for the divine powers and nowhere is any of the gods represented as the subordinate to others. It would be easy to find, in the numerous hymns of the Veda, passages in which almost every single god is represented as supreme and absolute.\"[85]\\n\\nUpanishads\\n\\nThe Vaishnava Upanishads are minor Upanishads of Hinduism, related to Vishnu theology. There are 14 Vaishnava Upanishads in the Muktika anthology of 108 Upanishads. It is unclear when these texts were composed, and estimates vary from the 1st-century BCE to 17th-century CE for the texts.\\n\\nThese Upanishads highlight Vishnu, Narayana, Rama or one of his avatars as the supreme metaphysical reality called Brahman in Hinduism.[89][90] They discuss a diverse range of topics, from ethics to the methods of worship.\\n\\nPuranas\\n\\nThe Bhagavata Purana (c. 16th century) is centred around Krishna, a Vishnu avatar.\\n\\nVishnu is the primary focus of the Vaishnavism-focused Puranas genre of Hindu texts. Of these, according to Ludo Rocher, the most important texts are the Bhagavata Purana, Vishnu Purana, Nāradeya Purana, Garuda Purana and Vayu Purana. The Purana texts include many versions of cosmologies, mythologies, encyclopedic entries about various aspects of life, and chapters that were medieval era regional Vishnu temples-related tourist guides called mahatmyas.\\n\\nOne version of the cosmology, for example, states that Vishnu\\'s eye is at the Southern Celestial Pole from where he watches the cosmos.[94] In another version found in section 4.80 of the Vayu Purana, he is the Hiranyagarbha, or the golden egg from which were simultaneously born all feminine and masculine beings of the universe.[95]\\n\\nVishnu Purana\\n\\nThe Vishnu Purana presents Vishnu as the central element of its cosmology, unlike some other Puranas where Shiva or Brahma or goddess Shakti are. The reverence and the worship of Vishnu is described in 22 chapters of the first part of Vishnu Purana, along with the profuse use of the synonymous names of Vishnu such as Hari, Janardana, Madhava, Achyuta, Hrishikesha and others.\\n\\nThe Vishnu Purana also discusses the Hindu concept of supreme reality called Brahman in the context of the Upanishads; a discussion that the theistic Vedanta scholar Ramanuja interprets to be about the equivalence of the Brahman with Vishnu, a foundational theology in the Sri Vaishnavism tradition.[97]\\n\\nBhagavata Purana\\n\\nVishnu is equated with Brahman in the Bhagavata Purana, such as in verse 1.2.11, as \"learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this non-dual substance as Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan.\"[98]\\n\\nThe Bhagavata Purana has been the most popular and widely read Purana texts relating to Vishnu avatar Krishna, it has been translated and available in almost all Indian languages. Like other Puranas, it discusses a wide range of topics including cosmology, genealogy, geography, mythology, legend, music, dance, yoga and culture. As it begins, the forces of evil have won a war between the benevolent devas (deities) and evil asuras (demons) and now rule the universe. Truth re-emerges as the Vishnu avatar first makes peace with the demons, understands them and then creatively defeats them, bringing back hope, justice, freedom and good – a cyclic theme that appears in many legends.[102] The Bhagavata Purana is a revered text in Vaishnavism.[103] The Puranic legends of Vishnu have inspired plays and dramatic arts that are acted out over festivals, particularly through performance arts such as the Sattriya, Manipuri dance, Odissi, Kuchipudi, Kathakali, Kathak, Bharatanatyam, Bhagavata Mela and Mohiniyattam.[106]\\n\\nOther Puranas\\n\\nSome versions of the Purana texts, unlike the Vedic and Upanishadic texts, emphasize Vishnu as supreme and on whom other gods depend. Vishnu, for example, is the source of creator deity Brahma in the Vaishnavism-focussed Purana texts. Vishnu\\'s iconography and a Hindu myth typically shows Brahma being born in a lotus emerging from his navel, who then is described as creating the world or all the forms in the universe, but not the primordial universe itself. In contrast, the Shiva-focussed Puranas describe Brahma and Vishnu to have been created by Ardhanarishvara, that is half Shiva and half Parvati; or alternatively, Brahma was born from Rudra, or Vishnu, Shiva and Brahma creating each other cyclically in different aeons (kalpa).[109]\\n\\nIn some Vaishnava Puranas, Vishnu takes the form of Rudra or commands Rudra to destroy the world, thereafter the entire universe dissolves and along with time, everything is reabsorbed back into Vishnu. The universe is then recreated from Vishnu all over again, starting a new Kalpa.[110] For this the Bhagavata Purana employs the metaphor of Vishnu as a spider and the universe as his web. Other texts offer alternate cosmogenic theories, such as one where the universe and time are absorbed into Shiva.[110][111]\\n\\nAgama\\n\\nThe Agama scripture called the Pancharatra describes a mode of worship of Vishnu.\\n\\nSangam and Post-Sangam literature\\n\\nThe Sangam literature refers to an extensive regional collection in the Tamil language, mostly from the early centuries of the common era. These Tamil texts revere Vishnu and his avatars such as Krishna and Rama, as well as other pan-Indian deities such as Shiva, Muruga, Durga, Indra and others.[112] Vishnu is described in these texts as Mayon, or \"one who is dark or black in color\" (in north India, the equivalent word is Krishna).[112] Other terms found for Vishnu in these ancient Tamil genre of literature include mayavan, mamiyon, netiyon, mal and mayan.[113]\\n\\nKrishna as Vishnu avatar is the primary subject of two post-Sangam Tamil epics Silappadikaram and Manimekalai, each of which was probably composed about the 5th century CE.[114][115] These Tamil epics share many aspects of the story found in other parts of India, such as those related to baby Krishna such as stealing butter, and teenage Krishna such as teasing girls who went to bathe in a river by hiding their clothes.[114][116]\\n\\nBhakti movement\\n\\nIdeas about Vishnu in the mid 1st millennium CE were important to the Bhakti movement theology that ultimately swept India after the 12th century. The Alvars, which literally means \"those immersed in God\", were Tamil Vaishnava poet-saints who sang praises of Vishnu as they traveled from one place to another.[117] They established temple sites such as Srirangam, and spread ideas about Vaishnavism. Their poems, compiled as Alwar Arulicheyalgal or Divya Prabhandham, developed into an influential scripture for the Vaishnavas. The Bhagavata Purana\\'s references to the South Indian Alvar saints, along with its emphasis on bhakti, have led many scholars to give it South Indian origins, though some scholars question whether this evidence excludes the possibility that bhakti movement had parallel developments in other parts of India.[119]\\n\\nVaishnava theology\\n\\nThe Bhagavata Purana summarizes the Vaishnava theology, wherein it frequently discusses the merging of the individual Self with the Absolute Brahman (Ultimate Reality, Supreme Truth), or \"the return of Brahman into His own true nature\", a distinctly Advaitic or non-dualistic philosophy of Shankara.[120] The concept of moksha is explained as Ekatva (\\'Oneness\\') and Sayujya (\\'Absorption, intimate union\\'), wherein one is completely lost in Brahman (Self, Supreme Being, one\\'s true nature).[122] This, states Rukmini (1993), is proclamation of \"return of the individual Self to the Absolute and its merging into the Absolute\", which is unmistakably Advaitic in its trend.[122] In the same passages, the Bhagavata includes a mention of Bhagavan as the object of concentration, thereby presenting the Bhakti path from the three major paths of Hindu spirituality discussed in the Bhagavad Gita.[122][123]\\n\\nVaishnava thought holds Vishnu to exist in the alternate guise of \"Isvara, the Lord of All Being\" and the universe to be his breath that he will \"assimilate\" into him again, by breathing and causing the end of the world, which has happened before. Afterwards, he will \"exhale again and re-create the world.\"\\n\\nThe theology in the Bhagavad Gita discusses both the sentient and the non-sentient, the Self and the matter of existence. It envisions the universe as the body of Vishnu (Krishna), state Harold Coward and Daniel Maguire. Vishnu in Gita\\'s theology pervades all selves, all matter, and time,[124] and is associated with Brahman. In Sri Vaishnavism sub-tradition, Vishnu and Sri (goddess Lakshmi) are described as inseparable, that they pervade everything together. Both together are the creators, who also pervade and transcend their creation.[124]\\n\\nThe Bhagavata Purana, in many passages, parallels the ideas of Nirguna Brahman and non-duality of Adi Shankara. For example:\\n\\nThe aim of life is an inquiry into the Truth, and not the desire for enjoyment in heaven by performing religious rites,\\n\\nThose who possess the knowledge of the Truth, call the knowledge of non-duality as the Truth,\\n\\nIt is called Brahman, the Highest Self, and Bhagavan. Sūta, Bhagavata Purana 1.2.10–11, translated by Daniel Sheridan [ 125 ]\\n\\nScholars describe the Vaishnava theology as built on the foundation of non-dualism speculations in Upanishads, and term it as \"Advaitic Theism.\" The Bhagavata Purana suggests that Vishnu and the Self (Atman) in all beings is one.[120] Bryant states that the monism discussed in Bhagavata Purana is certainly built on the Vedanta foundations, but not exactly the same as the monism of Adi Shankara.[127] The Bhagavata asserts, according to Bryant, that the empirical and the spiritual universe are both metaphysical realities, and manifestations of the same Oneness, just like heat and light are \"real but different\" manifestations of sunlight.[127]\\n\\nIn the Bhakti tradition of Vaishnavism, Vishnu is attributed with numerous qualities such as omniscience, energy, strength, lordship, vigour, and splendour.[128] The Vaishnava tradition started by Madhvacharya considers Vishnu in the form of Krishna to be the supreme creator, personal God, all-pervading, all devouring, one whose knowledge and grace leads to \"moksha\".[129] In Madhvacharya Vaishnava theology, the supreme Vishnu and the Selfs of living beings are two different realities and nature (dualism), while in Ramanuja\\'s Sri Vaishnavism, they are different but share the same essential nature (qualified non-dualism).[130][131][132]\\n\\nAssociated deities\\n\\nLakshmi\\n\\nVishnu with Lakshmi (Lakshmi Narayan) on Garuda, painted in gouache c. 1820\\n\\nLakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth, fortune and prosperity (both material and spiritual), is the wife and active energy of Vishnu.[133][134] She is also called Sri.[135][136] When Vishnu incarnated on earth as the avatars Rama and Krishna, Lakshmi incarnated as his respective consorts: Sita and Radha or Rukmini.[137][138]\\n\\nVarious regional beliefs consider Lakshmi to be manifested as various goddesses, who are considered Vishnu\\'s wives. In South India, Lakshmi is worshipped in two forms – Sridevi and Bhudevi.[139] In Tirupati, Venkateshwara (identified as a form of Vishnu) is depicted with consorts, Lakshmi and Padmavathi.[140]\\n\\nGaruda\\n\\nAmong Vishnu\\'s primary mounts (vahana) is Garuda, the demigod eagle. Vishnu is commonly depicted as riding on his shoulders. Garuda is also considered as Vedas on which Vishnu travels. Garuda is a sacred bird in Vaishnavism. In the Garuda Purana, Garuda carries Vishnu to save the elephant Gajendra.[141][142]\\n\\nShesha\\n\\nVishnu sleeps on the coils of Ananta (Shesha, the World Snake). He will awake for the next cycle of creation which heralds the destruction of all things. 14th century sculpture from India, housed in National Museum of Scotland\\n\\nOne of the primordial beings of creation, Shesha, or Adishesha, is the king of the serpents in Hindu mythology.[143] Residing in Vaikuntha, Vishnu sleeps upon Adishesha in a perpetual slumber in his form of Narayana.[144]\\n\\nVishvaksena\\n\\nVishvaksena, also known as Senadhipathi (both meaning \\'army-chief\\'), is the commander-in-chief of the army of Vishnu.\\n\\nHarihara\\n\\nHarihara – Combined form of Vishnu and Shiva, c. 1825\\n\\nShiva and Vishnu are both viewed as the ultimate form of god in different Hindu denominations. Harihara is a composite of half Vishnu and half Shiva, mentioned in literature such as the Vamana Purana (chapter 36),[145] and in artwork found from mid 1st millennium CE, such as in the cave 1 and cave 3 of the 6th-century Badami cave temples.[146][147] Another half Vishnu half Shiva form, which is also called Harirudra, is mentioned in Mahabharata.[148]\\n\\nBeyond Hinduism\\n\\nSikhism\\n\\nVishnu is referred to as Gorakh in the scriptures of Sikhism.[149] For example, in verse 5 of Japji Sahib, the Guru (\\'teacher\\') is praised as who gives the word and shows the wisdom, and through whom the awareness of immanence is gained. Guru Nanak, according to Shackle and Mandair (2013), teaches that the Guru are \"Shiva (isar), Vishnu (gorakh), Brahma (barma) and mother Parvati (parbati),\" yet the one who is all and true cannot be described.[150]\\n\\nThe Chaubis Avtar lists the 24 avatars of Vishnu, including Krishna, Rama, and Buddha. Similarly, the Dasam Granth includes Vishnu mythology that mirrors that found in the Vaishnav tradition.[151] The latter is of particular importance to Sanatan Sikhs, including Udasis, Nirmalas, Nanakpanthis, Sahajdhari, and Keshdhari/Khalsa sects of Sikhism; however, the Khalsa Sikhs disagree with the Sanatan Sikhs.[151][152] According to Sanatan Sikh writers, the Gurus of Sikhism were avatars of Vishnu, because the Gurus brought light in the age of darkness and saved people in a time of evil Mughal-era persecution.[153][154][155]\\n\\nBuddhism\\n\\nTheravada Buddhism\\n\\nVishnu bearing a tray of flowers. A painting of the relic chamber of Mahiyangana Stupa (9-11 centuries CE). Currently displayed at Archaeological Museum of Anuradhapura.\\n\\nA modern Buddhist Vishnu shrine in Dondra, Sri Lanka.\\n\\nWhile some Hindus consider Buddha as an incarnation of Vishnu, Buddhists in Sri Lanka venerate Vishnu as the custodian deity of Sri Lanka and protector of Buddhism.[156]\\n\\nVishnu is also known as Upulvan or Upalavarṇā, meaning \\'Blue Lotus coloured\\'. Some postulate that Uthpala varna was a local deity who later merged with Vishnu while another belief is that Utpalavarṇā was an early form of Vishnu before he became a supreme deity in Puranic Hinduism. According to the chronicles of Mahāvaṃsa, Cūḷavaṃsa, and folklore in Sri Lanka, Buddha himself handed over the custodianship to Vishnu. Others believe that Buddha entrusted this task to Sakra (Indra), who delegated this task of custodianship to Vishnu.[157] Many Buddhist and Hindu shrines are dedicated to Vishnu in Sri Lanka. In addition to specific Vishnu Kovils or Devalayas, all Buddhist temples necessarily house shrine rooms (Devalayas) closer to the main Buddhist shrine dedicated to Vishnu.[158]\\n\\nJohn Holt states that Vishnu was one of the several Hindu gods and goddesses who were integrated into the Sinhala Buddhist religious culture, such as the 14th and 15th-century Lankatilaka and Gadaladeniya Buddhist temples.[159] He states that the medieval Sinhala tradition encouraged Visnu worship (puja) as a part of Theravada Buddhism just like Hindu tradition incorporated the Buddha as an avatar of Vishnu, but contemporary Theravada monks are attempting to purge the Vishnu worship practice from Buddhist temples.[160] According to Holt, the veneration of Vishnu in Sri Lanka is evidence of a remarkable ability over many centuries, to reiterate and reinvent culture as other ethnicities have been absorbed into their own. Though the Vishnu cult in Ceylon was formally endorsed by Kandyan kings in the early 1700s, Holt states that Vishnu images and shrines are among conspicuous ruins in the medieval capital Polonnaruwa.\\n\\nVishnu iconography such as statues and etchings have been found in archaeological sites of Southeast Asia, now predominantly of the Theravada Buddhist tradition. In Thailand, for example, statues of four-armed Vishnu have been found in provinces near Malaysia and dated to be from the 4th to 9th-century, and this mirror those found in ancient India.[161] Similarly, Vishnu statues have been discovered from the 6th to 8th century eastern Prachinburi Province and central Phetchabun Province of Thailand and southern Đồng Tháp Province and An Giang Province of Vietnam. Krishna statues dated to the early 7th century to 9th century have been discovered in Takéo Province and other provinces of Cambodia.\\n\\nMahayana Buddhism\\n\\nNīlakaṇṭha-Avalokiteśvara (青頸観音 Shōkyō-kannon), from the Besson-zakki (別尊雑記 \"Miscellaneous Record of Classified Sacred Images\"), as reproduced in the Taishō Shinshū Daizōkyō Zuzō-bu (大正新脩大藏經 圖像部), vol. 3.\\n\\nNārāyaṇa (那羅延天 Naraen-ten), the Chinese Buddhist version of Hindu God Vishnu, from volume 9 of the Shoson Zuzōshō (諸尊図像鈔), a compendium of Buddhist images.\\n\\nIn Mahayana Buddhism sources, Vishnu (along with other deities) was adopted into the vast pantheon of Buddhist deities. These deities are often associated with the multiform Avalokiteśvara. Mahayana Buddhism holds that Avalokiteśvara is able to manifest in different forms according to the needs of different beings (a doctrine called \"skillful means\" - upaya). The Lotus Sūtra states that Avalokiteśvara can take many different forms, including Īśvara and Maheśvara - to teach the Dharma to various classes of beings.[164]\\n\\nAnother Mahayana sutra, the Kāraṇḍavyūhasūtra, names Vishnu (along with Shiva, Brahma and Saraswati), as emanations of Avalokiteśvara, now seen as a transcendent deity out of which the entire world emanates.[165] The Karandavyuha states that Narayana was emanated from Avalokiteshvara\\'s heart (hṛdayānnārāyaṇaḥ), as a skillful means (upaya) for the benefit of all beings. In a similar manner, Harihara is called a bodhisattva in the popular Nīlakaṇṭha Dhāraṇī, which states: \"O Effulgence, World-Transcendent, come, oh Hari, the great bodhisattva.\"[166]\\n\\nFurthermore, the Ratnamalastotra states:\\n\\nIn order to teach the Vaishnavas and convert then to the Dharma, he (Vishnu) emanated from the heart of the lotus holder (Avalokitesvara). He is truly Narayana indeed, the lord of the world. Thus, you are indeed the greatest being (puṁsāṁ paramottama), without equal.[167]\\n\\nThese Indian Buddhist sources depict a stage of the development of Indian Mahayana in which Vishnu (along with Shiva) was being assimilated into a supreme universal form of Avalokiteśvara which is similar to the Hindu concept of Viśvarūpa.[168]\\n\\nLater Vajrayana sources continue to refer to Vishnu as a form of Avalokiteśvara. For example, the Sadhanamala contains a spiritual practice in which one meditates on a form of Vishnu called Harihariharivāhana or Harihariharivāhanalokeśvara.[169] This form includes Avalokiteśvara riding on Vishnu who in turn rides on Garuda, who also rides a lion.[170] This form of Lokeśvara might be Nepalese in origin and its source myth might be found in the Buddhist Swayambhu Purana.[171]\\n\\nArcheological studies have uncovered Vishnu statues on the islands of Indonesia, which was once a great stronghold of Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism. These statues have been dated to the 5th century and thereafter. In addition to statues, inscriptions and carvings of Vishnu, such as those related to the \"three steps of Vishnu\" (Trivikrama) have been found in many parts of Buddhist southeast Asia. In some iconography, the symbolism of Surya, Vishnu and Buddha are fused.\\n\\nIn Japanese Buddhist pantheon, Vishnu is known as Bichū-ten (毘紐天), and he appears in Japanese texts such as the 13th century compositions of Nichiren.[175]\\n\\nIn science\\n\\n4034 Vishnu is an asteroid discovered by Eleanor F. Helin.[176] Vishnu rocks are a type of volcanic sediment found in the Grand Canyon, Arizona, USA. Consequently, mass formations are known as Vishnu\\'s temples.[177]\\n\\nOutside the Indian subcontinent\\n\\nIndonesia\\n\\nIn Indonesia, Vishnu or Wisnu (Indonesian spelling) is a well-known figure in the world of wayang (Indonesian puppetry), Wisnu is often referred to as the title Sanghyang Batara Wisnu. Wisnu is the god of justice or welfare, Wisnu was the fifth son of Batara Guru and Batari Uma. He is the most powerful son of all the sons of Batara Guru.\\n\\nWisnu is described as a god who has bluish black or dark blue skin, has four arms, each of which holds a weapon, namely a mace, a lotus, a trumpet and a Cakra. He can also do tiwikrama, become an infinitely large giant.\\n\\nAccording to Javanese mythology, Wisnu first came down to the world and became a king with the title Srimaharaja Suman. The country is called Medangpura, located in the present-day Central Java region. Then changed its name to Sri Maharaja Matsyapati. In addition, according to the Javanese wayang puppet version, Batara Wisnu also incarnates Srimaharaja Kanwa, Resi Wisnungkara, Prabu Arjunasasrabahu, Sri Ramawijaya, Sri Batara Kresna, Prabu Airlangga, Prabu Jayabaya, Prabu Anglingdarma.\\n\\nIn Javanese mythology, Wisnu also incarnated as a matsya (fish) to kill the giant Hargragiwa who stole the Veda. Become Narasingha (human with a tiger head) to destroy King Hiranyakashipu. He once intended to become a Wimana (dwarf) to defeat Ditya Bali. Batara Wisnu also incarnated in Ramaparasu to destroy gandarwa. Incarnated as Arjunasasra or Arjunawijaya to defeat King Rahwana. The last one was for King Krishna to become the great Pandavas parampara or advisor to get rid of greed and evil committed by the Kauravas.\\n\\nSang Hyang Wisnu has a mount in the form of a giant garuda named Bhirawan. Because of his affection for the garuda he rode, Bhirawan was then adopted as son-in-law, married to one of his daughters named Dewi Kastapi.[178]\\n\\nTemples\\n\\nThe front-view of Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala\\n\\nSome of the earliest surviving grand Vishnu temples in India have been dated to the Gupta Empire period. The Sarvatobhadra temple in Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, for example, is dated to the early 6th century and features the ten avatars of Vishnu.[180] Its design based on a square layout and Vishnu iconography broadly follows the 1st millennium Hindu texts on architecture and construction such as the Brihat Samhita and Visnudharmottarapurana.[182]\\n\\nArchaeological evidence suggest that Vishnu temples and iconography probably were already in existence by the 1st century BCE. The most significant Vishnu-related epigraphy and archaeological remains are the two 1st century BCE inscriptions in Rajasthan which refer to temples of Sankarshana and Vasudeva, the Besnagar Garuda column of 100 BCE which mentions a Bhagavata temple, another inscription in Naneghat cave in Maharashtra by a Queen Naganika that also mentions Sankarshana, Vasudeva along with other major Hindu deities and several discoveries in Mathura relating to Vishnu, all dated to about the start of the common era.[184][185]\\n\\nThe Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, is dedicated to Vishnu. The temple has attracted huge donations in gold and precious stones over its long history.[186][187][188][189]\\n\\nList of temples\\n\\nVishnu temple at Prambanan trimurti temple compound, Yogyakarta, Indonesia\\n\\n2) with a perimeter of 4,116 m (13,504 ft) making it the largest temple in India and one of the largest religious complexes in the world.
